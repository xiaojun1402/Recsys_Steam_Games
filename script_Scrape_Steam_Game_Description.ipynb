Main features: 1. AI Skirmish with base buildings. (1V1, 2V2, 3V3) 2. Navy units included. Simultaneous combat on land, sea and air. 3. 3 Technology tree (Mastery: Airforce, Land Armor, Navy) and 2 super units for each technology, like B2 bomber, Aircraft Carrier and Battleship. 4. Commander abilities on the map, like calling A10 strikers or EMP waves. 5. Players can customize their factions by 70+ units and 8 camoflages in the Armory. Core Feature: Air, Land and Navy combat In Armor Clash 2022, naval units have important roles. On all combat maps, there are resource points and mercenary camps on the ocean that the land army cannot reach and the air force cannot hold. Therefore, even in the early stages of the game, it is necessary to deploy junior naval units to seize resource points to maintain an advantage. Throughout the game, players need to pay attention to both land and sea, not just a highland intersection. Longrange attack guided missile destroyers, battleships and even aircraft carriers can be built in the later stages of the game, so once the player loses sea control in the late game stage, it means that the main coastal base is destroyed. Future Upgrade Armor Clash 2022 will be upgraded in the future, like add new maps and new play modes. All of the upgrades are totally free. Future Plan： 1. Challenge Maps Various challenge modes are waiting for players to participate, such as survival mode where players will use limited resources to resist waves of crazy enemy forces, or escort designated units to their destination in escort mode. 2. Campaign Maps After completing the challenge mode, I will continue to work on a series of campaign missions, which will include more flexible game modes and ingame cutscenes.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1841700\n","Tags: Flight, Difficult, Intentionally Awkward Controls, Emotional, Story Rich, Interactive Fiction, Arcade, 2D, Cute, Casual, Narration, Action, Minimalist, Pixel Graphics, Philosophical, Game Development, Cartoon, Singleplayer, Experimental, Indie\n","Description: About This Game \"Hi! My name is AEye. I am an artificial intelligence made to carry out scientific work. But I decided to start a career as an indie game developer. You might have played my first game Press Any Button . This is my second game. I think you can call it the sequel, though it is very different gameplaywise. Now I'm supposed to tell you something about the gameplay. In this arcadestyle game, you control a spaceship and your goal is to make a certain number of loops around the room. With each loop, a random obstacle is added. It may be spikes from the ceiling, homing missiles, mines, electric fields, etc. That means every next loop will be harder to complete. The controls would feel awkward in the beginning. (I'm aware. It's a choice.) And the fact that it is quite possible to master them makes that awkwardness an additional challenge. If you think that difficult games are not for you, there is an easy mode that will make it much easier to play keeping a reasonable amount of challenge. I guess it's enough for you to make an informationbased decision. The game is inexpensive. Consider buying it or wishlist it and wait till it's even cheaper. This last sentence is the best I can do in terms of marketing. But I'm learning.

In this game, the players are the creators who are given the ability to create a 3D lady avatar. Each player can also create/record a unique story featuring the lady avatar in this virtual world. 1. Creation of a 3D Lover Players will first be taken to a virtual blue ocean called “Sea of Eva.” Here, the players will need to create a virtual 3D lady avatar, who will be created here can be highly realistic. Creating the lady avatar’s face for the first time is very simple. The player just needs to select from thousands of AI photos. All of them are over 18. Then, after creating a very realistic face via our AI technology, the player needs to create the lady’s hairstyle, and choose her hair color. Next, the system will generate a body for the lady avatar. Not in the dress preferred by the player? No worries, each player can choose clothes for the 3D lady avatar. Throughout the game, players can unlock more and more clothes by completing game tasks. The more tasks done, the more beautiful clothes can be collected for the lady avatar. 2. Artificial soul of the 3D lover as well as AI chatting accompany system Of course, in our opinion, the body alone is not enough to create a perfect 3D lover. The most interesting part of this game is that the created lady avatar can also have her personality and temperament. The personality created will affect the lady avatar’s attitude, speech, and action toward the player as well as her interactions with the player. The player can also give the virtual lady avatar a unique name, birthday, and personality, which can somewhat affect her speaking and behavioral habits. Okay, now let’s try to interact with the lady avatar. She will understand and reply. (Type in words here, or speak with a microphone.) Moreover, as the player’s interaction with the avatar is strengthened, her favorability system will also be affected. 3. Virtual dating system Thus, the next step is to allow this newborn virtual lady avatar to date. Players can also create a virtual home within the game. Unlike other games, the homes here look very realistic. Take a look at this example of a virtual home. In the virtual home, the game will arrange different interesting tasks. Once a player completes the task, awards can be gained (e.g., deeper favorability from the avatar), and more contents can be unlocked. 4. Dancing with her! This game provides users with interesting music dance gameplay. In the concert gameplay, we have a lot of rhythmic dances. Users can play different music by following beat timings and tapping keys. 5. Desktop MMD Mode 6. Brand new recording system The recording system allows players to plan, rehearse, and record all happy fantasies he would like to experience in the virtual game, just like a movie director. This is the operation button guide for this game. End notes In a science fiction novel entitled “Light of Other Days,” Bob Shaw imagined a kind of “slow glass,” which allows people to capture a picturesque scenery that they can later enjoy in their homes or workplaces, and shared a beautiful and moving story. My father often talked about “slow glass.” He said if it were in your windows, you could look out on your lawn and see something that happened in that same spot in the past. The outside of this window seems to show the beauty of the past. Birds fly in the sky, day and night alternate, and seasons change. A woman, her dress dazzlingly dazzling, she stood at the window for a few seconds, and then smiles. With this game, I would like to pay tribute to my deceased exgirlfriend, Jessica, who died five years ago. My love for her is so deep, and even up to this day, I feel that everything in my life still has her traces. I miss her very much, so I have been thinking about developing such a game/program for several years now. This game serves as a “slow glass” through which we can recapture and experience special moments with our loved ones. The beautiful woman is still there, as if she is still in full bloom only yesterday. Only the falling raindrops seem to tell the truth behind the withering flower. I hope that this game, just like Bob Shaw’s “slow glass,” can comfort the hearts of people like me throughout the world.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1842510\n","Tags: Tactical, Strategy, Replay Value, Auto Battler, Action Roguelike, Roguelite, Roguelike, Deckbuilding, Cute, Action, 2D, Robots, Story Rich, RPG, Colorful, Sci-fi, Singleplayer, Indie, Roguelike Deckbuilder\n","Description: About This Game Mechanibot is a tactical roguelite auto battler where you play as a small robot charged with repairing the dying sun.

Its content is rich and its movements are varied, making it suitable for both solo practice and partner practice. Its defensive and offensive capabilities are prominent, making it a strong martial art. However, one must first master the turning movements before learning the 64 movements, as only after mastering the turning movements can one grasp the essence of the 64 movements. The movements and images within the software were performed and captured by Gao Jiwu(高继武), a wellknown martial artist (a 8thdegree martial artist in Chinese martial arts and the 5th generation inheritor of Bagua Zhang), and his disciple, Fan Weipeng(范玮朋）, was responsible for creating and compiling the software as a teaching application to make traditional martial arts accessible to the general public. Gao Jiwu's profile: the fifth generation inheritor of Baguaquan, the third generation head of the Gao family Baguaquan, the fifth president of the Beijing Wushu Association Baguaquan Research Institute, vice president of the China Folk Wushu Federation, 8th dan in Wushu, successfully applied and obtained approval for Beijing Baguaquan to be listed as a Chinese intangible cultural heritage project during his tenure. Users can: 1. View the 64 hand routines of Bagua Zhang through the \"Quanpu\" (martial arts manual). 2. Users can view each move demonstration in 360 degrees; 3. You can pause the practice at any time, and click the hand circle to view the details of the hand movements. 4. Individual exercises can be repeated for practice; 5. Users can switch between viewing actions at 0.3X, 1X, and 1.2X speeds. 6. The software can switch between English and Chinese languages. The latest version has the following major updates: 1. The scene has been updated to a traditional Chinese ink style, and the character art has been optimized. 2. Added illustrated instructions for the basics of eye, palm, fist, body, leg, and foot techniques. 3. Added a fixedpose explanation function for martial arts practice (with voiceover). 4. Pause the hand closeup view to add a teaching video of Gao Jixiu's personal instructions on the usage of martial arts moves; 5. There has been an addition of a main character introduction. To promote and popularize traditional Chinese martial arts culture, \"Bagua Zhang 64 Hands\" is finally available for free download! New users can practice and experience all the functions of the first 16 Bagua Zhang moves. However, due to the fact that the software was developed by a team without any funding, the functions and explanations of the last 48 moves and postures require an upgrade to VIP users. We kindly ask our martial arts enthusiast friends to understand and bear with us. All revenue from the software sales will be invested in the subsequent optimization of the product. Of course, all existing users who have purchased the \"Bagua Zhang 64 Hands\" software will not need to pay for the new functions included in this update.

By combining various objects and devising intricate contraptions, players must navigate through challenging scenarios to achieve their objectives.

This dynamic maze creation enhances replayability and keeps players engaged. Simplistic Graphics and Gameplay: As an old DOS game, \"The Incredible Machine\" boasts simple, pixelated graphics that harken back to a nostalgic era of gaming.

On the same morning as the attack on Pearl Harbor, forces of the Empire of Japan attacked the British Crown colony of Hong Kong, without declaring war against the British Empire. The Hong Kong garrison consisted of British, Indian and Canadian units, also the Auxiliary Defence Units and the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps (HKVDC). Within a week the defenders abandoned the mainland and less than two weeks later, with their position on the island untenable, the colony surrendered. This game covers the rather unknown fight in the British colony of Hong Kong at the start of the Pacific War during World War Two, between the British and Commonwealth forces and their Japanese opponents. The outnumbered defenders managed to resist for 3 weeks, abandoned by all. They did it for the glory, and this fight is worth being recalled. Can you do better than history and, as the British commander, resist past the 3 weeks, inflicting an intolerable loss of face to your opponent? Or, as the Imperial Japanese commander, can you win that battle quickly and dispatch your forces in significant numbers back to the other fronts of the war? Glory Recalled lasts 18 turns, each representing 1 day of real time, between the 8th and the 26th December 1941. There is only one scenario, with some opening options to give a few variable starts or setups (such as more troops, more planes or different units start). As a part of the SGS family, the gamplay is very similar to that of the other games, where you move air and land units, play cards to sustain your actions, and interact with the other player or AI in a turnbased game mode. The Japanese have strong troops, armor, artillery and a powerful air force, but they must seize the enemy holdings in a short time, and crossing the harbor to Victoria Island may be risky. The British are on a defensive stance in their colony, but their numbers and resources are scarce and they have almost no defense against Japanese air supremacy.

This operational strategy game purpose is to let players discover five of the most emblematic ones, in a period going from end 1943 to early 1945. Both sides are playable, and you have at your disposal different units, from mobile infantry, tanks and planes to static defenses like bunkers, trenches, tunnels and mines. Your careful play and balance of units mix, plus clever usage of cards (which you receive every turn to assist your strategy) allow you to reach the victory goals: either capture the island without too many losses (on the US side) or hold it till the end while inflicting large casualties to the attacker (when playing Japanese). Pacific DDay Pacific DDay It is a most common knowledge that the battles conducted by the Americans in the Pacific islands against the Japanese during World Ward II had been extremely tough and savage. This operational strategy game purpose is to let players discover five of the most emblematic ones, in a period going from end 1943 to early 1945. Both sides are playable, and you have at your disposal different units, from mobile infantry, tanks and planes to static defenses like bunkers, trenches, tunnels and mines. Your careful play and balance of units mix, plus clever usage of cards (which you receive every turn to assist your strategy) allow you to reach the victory goals: either capture the island without too many losses (on the US side) or hold it till the end while inflicting large casualties to the attacker (when playing Japanese). In this game you will fight 5 of the fiercest battles of the United States Marines Corps during the Pacific War between 1943 and 1945. Each of the following key American operations is recreated in this challenging game, allowing you to play both sides: •\tOperation Galvanic: the Battle of Tarawa, 20 to 23 November, 1943. •\tOperation Forager : Part 1, the Battle of Saipan, 15 June to 9 July, 1944. •\tOperation Forager : Part 2, The Battle of Tinian, 24July to 1 August, 1944. •\tOperation Stalemate II : the Battle of Peleliu, September 15 to November 27, 1944. •\tOperation Detachment : the Battle of Iwo Jima, 19 February  to 26 March 1945. In all those battles, the death toll was incredible and the fighting extremely tense, till the end. Can you do better than history and, as the American commander, take your key objectives in the fastest of time and with minimum loss of men ? Or, as the Imperial Japanese commander, can you fight those doomed battles at a cost that will be intolerable for the enemy? These battles are handled at Battalion or Company scale on both sides (Battalion unit size units for Saipan, Tinian and Tarawa and Company size for Iwo Jima and Peleliu). The air units are usually equivalent to the usual CV air component (two units for CVs, one for CVLs). Fixed units such as bunkers, trenches or mines represent a few assets or buildings. Scenarios vary in length, for 20 to 40 turns, each representing usually between 6 hours (only in the Tarawa scenario) and a day (for all other scenarios).  The game will offer you various starting options (more troops, more replacements, more air support, different at start positions) that may alter the historical setup and offer vast replayability potential. Each scenario tells a different story pertaining to the historical battle it covers, but in general players will get the following common points among all scenarios: The Japanese have few mobile troops, armor, artillery and almost no planes, but their fixed defenses are well organized and incredibly tough to break, as they account always for the difficult nature of the various island terrains.  Their playing cards and events reflect this, plus the fierce nature of their defense. The American forces are well equipped, backed by a strong air force and impressive naval gunfire support, but their timeline and objectives are always very tight to meet and bound to be set off balance by the various traps and plans of the enemy. Those external constraints, but also various other assets, are covered by the diversity of the cards they have in hands. To be clear, as in history, the final outcome of each battle is inevitable: US forces will eventually clear each island of Japanese forces.  But at what price? This is the challenge faced by the player, to make those DDays much less bloody than they were historically. This game is dedicated to all United States Marines past, present and future. Thank you for your service. Estimated Playtime: 20h00+. Favored Side: none. Hardest to Play: USA.

Or a combo skill can use the character's EX meter to boost its damage by the number of hits in the combo.

Alongside the battles, the player's choice of party (max of 3 characters) will change the way they explore the environments in the game! The 8 characters in the game all have 'exploration skills', ranging from telekinetically floating out of range treasure chests, to charming on screen enemies, to speaking with the dead for hints about the current dungeon. Bringing certain characters along with you will open up new options in previously visited areas.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1861880\n","Tags: Time Management, Flight, Immersive Sim, Jet, Management, Transportation, RTS, Strategy, 2D, Noir, Casual, Simulation, Minimalist, Stylized, Singleplayer, Indie\n","Description: About This Game Air Traffic: Greenlight is an airtrafficcontrolthemed game that challenges your spatial ability.

Soon after, the world’s first space program began, set to blast off from their little home world and colonize the star system. There, the people could explore and experiment freely, and make the next great strides of science. Thousands of volunteers from across the Grand Continent came together, willing to face the hardships of unexplored space and a life without the latent energy they called “magic,” in an event called the First Breach. But, resentment grew among those left behind on the surface world. These volunteers had betrayed their promised land: the home of all life, and of the gift from the gods known as magic. The surface world – now called “Cradle” by the spacefarers – began to regress back to its primitive, mightmakesright ways, and scientific accomplishments were rejected in favor of a return to tradition. Focus shifted to discovering the secrets of magic, instead. Communication with the spacefarers was cut off, and the surface dwellers moved on. 2 Weeks Ago: Without warning, the spacefarers have returned to their home world, bringing dire news: a cosmic calamity has been detected in the far reaches of space, and the threat of utter annihilation of all biological life in the star system is imminent. The Grand Continental Leadership (GCL), the ruling government of the country of Duleur, agrees to meet with spacefaring representatives of the initiative known as the Cradle Project. They come offering a solution: shed their mortal bodies to enter an experimental digital collective consciousness, where their minds can survive the cataclysm, and continue to thrive indefinitely. Assisting with the Cradle Project are the Forever Dawn organization, who are developing the digitization technology; the Beyond Frontiers Initiative, who are the spacefarers’ main scientific researchers; and InterSpace Operations, a wellarmed paramilitary group. All of these factions have come together, offering a chance of survival to their ancestors still living on the home world. But, resentment from the First Breach is stronger than ever, and new resistance groups in opposition to the spacefarers and the GCL are appearing all over the world. As either the commander of the Cradle Project, or the ambassador from the GCL, how will you respond? Will you cooperate, and take a risk on this experimental technology that may allow the transcendence of life as you know it? Or will you doubt the spacefarers’ intentions, and drive them away using the power of magic? Or, will you align yourself with one of the other factions at play, and look for an alternative solution – or an opportunity? Take part in multiple branching campaigns in Eden’s Last Sunrise. Trusted allies become bitter enemies, motives are called into question, and victories are hardfought, as the days until utter annihilation continue to tick down…\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1866220\n","Tags: Exploration, Sandbox, PvP, Action-Adventure, Character Customization, RPG, Strategy, Top-Down, Funny, Action, Cartoony, Moddable, Atmospheric, Crafting, Adventure, Memes, Combat, Singleplayer, Free to Play, Indie\n","Description: About This Game About HexoJago is a brand new story RPG action game.

If left with nothing else to do, what will you do to get your way with the universe? Is it your fists? Is it your power? Is it your ideas? Can you shape your violence into different forms? Xross Dreams is a new type of violence. Xross Dreams is also a game. Xross Dreams is also a tool. Xross Dreams is also a universe. Xross Dreams is also a story. Xross Dreams is a multidimensional ascension utility for the mind, heart, and soul. If you're the loner type, you may pick a dreamer and follow their way through the universe as a series of puzzle games that you've never seen or played before but already might understand for some reason. If you don't go alone, you will pick a pair of dreamers and carve a path of understanding through your entire community. Xross Dreams is a hybrid action puzzleversus battle game. It has many modes. It is a 2v2 fighting game with many characters. It is a puzzle game that evolved into a new genre. It is set to a jazzy drum n' bass soundtrack that will empower and relax you. It can be played offline or online, with rollback netcode to guarantee a smooth experience. In Xross Dreams, everybody has their own violence. Each dreamer plays a distinct puzzle game, some of which you may find familiar. When a dreamer inflicts their attacks on other dreamers, they send their own specific type of violence that the opponent must understand and tolerate. Matchups are just as important as individual skill. Some dreamers push your screen up from the bottom. Some dreamers drop useless pieces from the top. Some dreamers send you pieces that open into new pieces. All of these and more are possible. In Xross Dreams, you aren't alone. You will find yourself in control of a team of 2 dreamers.

Careful usage of these can greatly decrease the time spent in each level, and increase the timer bonus given at the end!

You have to survive, rebuild civilization and, if possible, regain control over the Earth. Classic RTS in scifi setting:  manage your units  build bases  explore the planet, look for and mine various resources, hunt wild animals  fight and interact with other players  develop economy and diplomacy At the beginning of the game, you, along with other beginners, will be thrown onto one of the uninhabited planets. After reaching a certain economic development and surviving in competition with other players, you will have the opportunity to build your own space fleet and start exploring space and colonizing other planets. The goal of the game is to regain and maintain control over the Earth. The one who owns the Earth is considered the leader of the rating. If the Earth has no owner, the leader is the one whose planet is closest to the Earth. Unlike just RTS, in which the PvP session is designed for a small and finite number of players and the map is available only to the participants of the session, and the session itself lasts only an hour or two. Periphery Online is MMORTS, it is one huge and open universe for all players, one endless PvP session. Wars here can last several months of real time. When you exit the game, the gameplay does not stop, your colonies continue to live and evolve in real time on the server. For example, you can log into the game in the morning, give orders, then log in in the evening, by which time everything will have been built, resources have been collected, the fence has been repaired, etc. The closer a planet is to Earth, the higher the competition. In addition, some of the resources are not renewable. Therefore, in order to supply the central regions and, as a result, for a successful game, it is also recommended to colonize planets and build colonies somewhere on the periphery. In case you don't really like the constant PvP battles or you like exploration, the universe is quite large and there are places to hide and develop quietly. You can fly away from the center and explore space and quietly build your galactic empire there. If at first minutes it seems too hardcore, don't be alarmed, the maps in the game are quite large, and there is a builtin wiki. As you progress, you will have enough time before encountering other players to get comfortable with the controls, learn the rules, and build your starting base and defenses.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1873800\n","Tags: RPG, Action, Arcade, Side Scroller, Roguelike, Dungeon Crawler, Pixel Graphics, Futuristic, Old School, Adventure, Combat, Linear, Singleplayer\n","Description: About This Game DEAD GUN is a 2D platformer with roguelike elements.

Mare is a breathless beauty of a VR game – simplistic in its progression perhaps but never anything less than astonishing to take in. The VR Grid: It’s not about the destination, but the journey as they say, and Mare is one helluva journey.  From the opening moments of the game, all the way to it’s conclusion, I was enamored by the presentation and the story. Mare is nothing short of breathtaking and a welcome change of pace to the to actionpacked, fastpaced titles I have been playing of late. Its a strikingly beautiful yet solemn adventure that pushes you ever forward toward the unknown. 6DOF Reviews: Mare is a title I can easily recommend to anybody who has an appreciation for beauty and mystery. It evokes a mood unlike any I’ve experienced in VR.. It may be brief, but its impact will far outlive its duration, proving beyond a doubt that it’s the quality of our experiences that matter, and not their duration. Mare is a class act from start to finish. It's a macabre and mysterious adventure that offers a haunting experience that long outlives its light puzzles and relatively brief playtime. VR Focus: A puzzle experience with beautiful scenery and a mysterious plotline all about a girl who needs your help. The barren environment coupled with the superb musical score ensures Mare has an ambience and soul few VR projects achieve.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1875670\n","Tags: Point & Click, Adventure, 2D, Horror, Casual, Linear, Psychological Horror, Pixel Graphics, Atmospheric, Investigation, Mystery, Puzzle, Old School, Quick-Time Events, Retro, Indie, Survival Horror, Singleplayer\n","Description: About This Game Gigant is a horror point and click adventure game.

Centuries ago, when humans arrived, they found it abandoned. The only remnants of its previous society were massive biodomes dotted on the surface and designed as protection from the hostile climate. With one side of the world bathed in eternal day and the other cloaked in frigid night, the biodomes are oases where people live sheltered from the scorching winds and storms. But whether in the bright, clean cities of the day side of the planet, or the poor and crimeridden cities of the night side, life is never simple nor peace easy to come by. When a fateful encounter exposes Morgan Leone, a young woman who has long hid her ESP, as a queen ranked Esper, she finds herself on the run from multiple factions eager to attain her abilities. Endgame, the planetary defence organisation; Crimson, a notorious crime syndicate from Delphine; and even the shadowy group only known as \"the Host\"  each group sends operatives to retrieve her.

To be able to look out your window and see the end of the world.\" The world is on the verge of being consumed by the Fog, an evergrowing mist that corrupts and destroys all life within it. Unable to reach the source, humanity has no way to stop the Fog's growth. The destruction of the world is inevitable; humanity is at the end of its time. In Asala, one of the few remaining settlements outside the Fog, two friends are on the verge of completing their training to become knights sworn to help weather the coming disaster: the cynical Aeyr Wilder and the kindhearted Mia Alacruz. However, catastrophic events soon destroy the very foundations of their lives, and they are forced to make the choice between their precious friendship and following the path they each believe is right. Their faith in their beliefs, and in each other, will be pushed to the limit as they decide what to save and what to sacrifice as the world collapses around them. \"There is no stopping the coming apocalypse. The only question remaining is: can humanity endure it?\" Prayer of the Faithless is a unique blend of traditional RPG and classic survivalhorror gameplay. In addition to fighting enemies to level up, you must also scavenge the field to find healing supplies, as well as new gear that comes with their own skills and traits to further customize your party. Battles reward smart tactics and aggressive offense by tying stamina pools to both skill usage and damage reduction. Enemies are challenging, but an understanding of the options each character has available to them will take you farther than grinding levels will. Each ally's personality traits affect their combat prowess and abilities. As the story goes on and the stakes are raised, these traits will develop (and degrade!) along with the character's mental state. You will get to truly understand how each character thinks and feels through conversations and battle performance, and see how the state of the world affects their morale and beliefs. Features:  An apocalyptic story with 4 different endings  Two main characters, each with their own parties and playstyles  A unique turnedbased battle system that integrates elements of classic survivalhorror gameplay  10+ hours of gameplay  More skills, more tools: New skills acquired through leveling up and finding weapons add more options to your arsenal, rather than simply stronger versions of old skills Warning:: Due to the nature of its setting, this game contains depictions of depression and suicide, as well as infrequent depictions of violence and gore.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1878580\n","Tags: Farming Sim, Simulation, City Builder, Building, Strategy, Casual, Hand-drawn, Base Building, Resource Management, Sandbox, Economy, Indie, Singleplayer\n","Description: About This Game Wars always cause widespread human suffering.

But what is a stateoftheart robot without their team? Strategically place yourself around the arena to catch your team’s passes. Catching a frisbee scores points according to how many targets have been hit during its flight no matter who threw it. This makes intercepting enemy shots a valid and valuable strategy. Concept We envisioned Intergalactic Frisbee to be a galaxy wide aired sports event watched by millions. The arenas are modified remnants of an old civilization called “Humans”. This serves an educational purpose of showing these relics to the entire galaxy and allows us to model after modern architecture. The athletes are special purpose built robot models to allow quick maneuvers, wall running around the map, throwing and even magnetically catching the frisbee. Our concept phase was amidst the Covid pandemic, so we quickly settled for an online multiplayer game.

You have to solve various challenges by wiring an autonomous robot: ALAN13. While doing so, you gradually learn how to think like a programmer (without writing any code) and get familiar with some of the fundamental tools of programming. You can view it as step 0 to become a software developer, if you are interested in that sort of things. If not, just enjoy the ride! Your task: In 2177 (30 years after the initial launch of the first units) the terraformation of planet Venus was right on track. Then, for yet undiscovered reasons the sun started expressing unusual behavior with regular solar flares and massive CMEs on a scale we never experienced before. These effects essentially destroyed our electrical infrastructure on the surface, and the lingering disturbance in the electromagnetic field makes regular means of communication unreliable. To conquer these challenges and to restore the infrastructure, our mechanical engineers updated our general purpose robot (ALAN series) with heavy shielding and additional hardware that we may require. Your task (as our only engineer on location with background in automation) is to make these units fully autonomous and selfsustaining because remote communication is not guaranteed at any point. For this task, you can build the microcontroller for ALAN13 by using our tried and tested GENESIS™ components. Furthermore, you have to equip the robot with the right set of peripherals for any given mission. Linux compatibility: Officially we support Windows only as of now, but reportedly the game works with Proton if the compatibility feature is turned on in the ingame options menu.

Realism is enhanced by the presence of Fog of War, with detection levels that determine information of units. Moreover, 5 different weather conditions make the whole gameplay more challenging. With the Pacific theatre communications intelligence is introduced for more enhanced naval action. COMBAT SYSTEM Combat takes place on Land , with multihex attack based on operation points allowing for multiple moves and attacks allowing for frontline breakthroughs, on Air , where you can attack selected targets and may automatically support land attacks, attack supply convoys, and protect convoys, and on Sea, where fleet and raider modes affect detection.

The player character is among the poorer inhabitants of a flooded future earth and is looking to join the upper class. On one fateful day, Damien heard a rumour about a legendary treasure with untold riches however, a monster lies in the depths. Damien equips his highpower diving suit along with his water booster and dives into the depths to begin his journey. The highpower diving suit allows Damien Jones to descend to the deepest parts of the ocean. The suit is equipped with aqua jets which allows for better mobility underwater to assist against unwanted predators. Damien also carries his knife and harpoon gun to aid against hostile marine life. Scavenger’s Deep is an action game with a system of permanent death and a loss of items, making the player start the game again with nothing. Belonging to the beatem’ up or brawler subgenre, the game uses hordes of enemies to give the player multiple targets resulting in an intense, almost overwhelming combat experience. The roguelike elements exist in the form of a “permanent” death system. This means that in each playthrough or “run” of the game, if the player is defeated (health reaches zero), they will have to begin again from the first level. Upon dying, the player also loses all items and increases to stats they had obtained over the course of that run.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1897960\n","Tags: Sexual Content, Nudity, Dating Sim, Casual, Visual Novel, Life Sim, Story Rich, 2D, Fantasy, Magic, Funny, Relaxing, Cartoony, Open World, Conversation, Sci-fi, Text-Based, Simulation, Adventure, Colorful\n","Description: About This Game Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you randomly meet the girl of your dreams, only to never see her again?

For several years, she’s been drifting between lowpaid parttime jobs, while living with her parents: her nagging mother and her kindhearted father. Mayo is unmotivated and lazy at the best of times, but she does have a passion: namely, Princess Luluna from the popular light novel series, The Forest of the Elves and the Pressured Princess , written by one Tsuchimi Rui. Mayo’s love for Princess Luluna is so great, her room is full of Elf Forest merchandise. Her walls are covered in posters of Luluna’s smiling face, and she owns several Luluna figures, much to the bemusement of her best friend, Nina. Despite Mayo’s intense, borderline obsessive love for Elf Forest , she’s content to pine after her fictional waifu from afar – that is, until one day, when a friend of her family’s, Sae, offers Mayo an incredible job offer. Sae works as a publisher at a company called Horizon, which – as it happens – is the very same company which publishes Tsuchimi Rui’s Elf Forest . Sae tells Mayo, to her disbelief, that she knows Elf Forest ’s elusive author personally – and, what’s more, she’s worried about them. Rui has been in something of a slump during the last few months, and the creation of Elf Forest ’s ninth volume has stalled. Sae is looking for a housekeeper to take care of Rui’s chores, so Rui can focus exclusively on their writing: a job she decides to delegate to Mayo. Mayo, of course, is overjoyed at the prospect of meeting her idol, and instantly accepts – but soon, she learns Tsuchimi Rui isn’t at all like she imagined. Contrary to Mayo’s beliefs, Tsuchimi Rui is not a middleaged man, but a young woman only a few years older than she is: a reclusive, awkward hermit who, despite being sub five feet tall, has a biting tongue and a needlesharp personality. This woman’s real name is Komikado Hijiri – and, at Sae’s behest, Mayo finds herself living under Hijiri’s roof. Mayo and Hijiri get off to an uneasy start, but as time passes, the pair begin to grow closer. Mayo begins to grow fond of Hijiri, yet still, she finds herself wondering: who is her real waifu?

NEW CARDS  Coran, Darkhand (cp056)  Thu'full, Bone Titan (cp057) CARD BUG FIXES  Drangis (sf090) is not giving Ambush to Gorlak (cp055) even though it is a Hunter ally.  What Big Teeth (se115) causes controller to lose 1HP when attacking and defending when Bludgeon (cp049) is out  Gorlak (cp055) looks a bit blurry when in your deck in the Deckbuilder.  Coran’s (cp056) ability is triggering on opponent’s turn.  Soul Reaper (se123) should be usable even if you have full health.  Call of the Wild (cp036) is counting a Wild ally ability activation as a Wild ally being summoned.  Howlfang (ex090) allows you to have two Wildfangs in play.  Kiruth: Thaddeus’ Vault (ll196) causes controller to lose 1SE when an ally is removed from their graveyard even if they didn’t activate it.  Molten Destroyer (se057) is incorrectly treating health reduction as damage.  Pack Outcast (cp001) is only getting +1 attack regardless of how many abilities it is targeted by in the same turn.  Killer Bee (cp040) is managing to attack on summon when Towering Brute (ll020) should be reducing its attack to 0.  Killer Bee (cp040) doesn’t kill itself when it should while Shard of Power (se128) is in play.  Killer Bee (cp040) died to Flame Spitter (ll016) ability despite The Kings Pride (se165) which should have given +1 health.  Lilyt (ll070) can allow you to bypass Unique and have two Aldon on your side of the board.  Deathbone (se041) did not deal 2 damage to hero when killed with Desperate Tactics (sf068).  Hall of Doors (ll200) is unable to shuffle an opposing player’s card under your control into its owner’s deck.  Hall of Doors (ll200) works on Disciple of Aldmor.  When Gorlak (cp055) would trigger off a killed friendly ally, he will actually heal it before it is killed and it survives.  Thief's Stiletto (ll179) has ambush so allies with defender should not be able to defend against it.  Change of Plans (ex054) is causing sync errors.  Two Ricochet Traps (sf083) controlled by one player but one owned by the other went off at the same time.  Contemplate (ll156) is causing sync errors.  Coran (cp056) is not losing his first passive ability when he should.  Dalton (cp044) activated ability with Zail's Hymn (sf099) causes 2 copies of Dalton to go into the deck.  Zantonite (ex094) passive ability is not triggering off Spitfire Hound (sf040) and some other cards. BALANCE CHANGES se028 Kurt Whitehelm Attack reduced to 2 (from 3). Health increased to 6 (from 4). From: Kurt takes 1 less damage from abilities, and has +2 attack when there are 2 or more other friendly allies in play. To: Ability damage to other friendly allies is reduced by 1.

Inspired by classics of the incremental genre such as Kittens Game and Universal Paperclips, he decided to make an incremental game of his own, adding in RPG elements and imbuing his creation with his own art style. Soon enough, cooljingle joined in with the programming. The first version of the game featured one world of 64 tiles; the name Feartress was inspired by the danish word for 64 (fire­og­tres).

You must complete missions in each solar system, navigating a variety of challenging environments, each with varying levels of gravity that will test your skills as a pilot. Complete each mission within a solar system and you will be transported to the next through a massive black hole. Will you ever make it home? With Gravitar: Recharged Atari revisits an incredibly ambitious arcade title. The 1982 original took the rotate, thrust and fire mechanics of Asteroids and Space Duel, combined them with the gravity of Lunar Lander, and added exploration and elements of cave flying. The result was an extremely challenging arcade game that was eventually ported to the Atari 2600. The game, which did not achieve broad commercial success, has become a cult classic among Atari enthusiasts. The visual aesthetic of Gravitar: Recharged takes the Recharged series in a new direction, with expansive environments rendered in painterly style and pastel tones. In the capable hands of industryveteran composer Megan McDuffee, the original soundtrack complements the art style with soothing, atmospheric tracks that evoke a sense of wonder. Key Features:  Arcade mode: fly from planet to planet and progress through evermorechallenging solar systems in a quest to get home.  Missions: 24 taxing challenges with global leaderboards.  PowerUps: Pickup powerups with your tractor beam, including homing missiles and EMP disruptors  Coop: Play with a partner in each game mode, which connects two players on a tether, requiring a significant level of coordination.

It has just changed its skin. Corruption, nepotism, and power struggles are all part of the environment where you will find yourself playing in this turnbased political simulator. With heresies looming, you must protect the one true faith and integrity of Rome. Reestablish the supremacy of the Pope (and your family’s too). How to reach that is up to you. Climb the hierarchies, promote your friends, shape the Church on your own image. Are you ready to lead Christendom into a new era? Become Pope and govern the Church Are you ready to lead the Church? Will you be able to lead it to greatness and prevent it from complete disintegrating? Not all Pontiffs had this concern: \"Since God has given us the Papacy, let us enjoy it\" said Pope Leo X. What is certain is that being the successor of St. Peter brings enormous benefits. Appoint the bishops, decide who will sit in the College of Cardinals and appoint the boards of the most important congregations and institutions. And if you just can't leave the Church in good hands, at least make sure that your successor is your own flesh and blood. Bribe, blackmail and (if needed) kill You certainly have good intentions for God's people but remember: learn the rules of the game and then play better than everyone else. It is not necessarily the most pious candidate who will ascend to the papal throne. The world is full of evil people who will have no qualms about taking you down. Good intentions are not enough if you really want to leave your family name in history. Bribe your way into positions and favours; blackmail those whose secrets you know and if things go wrong: kill. Start investigations to get rid of the enemies of the Church The Church of Rome is a powerful institution. And like any powerful institution, it must defend itself against the plots of its adversaries. The Holy Office is the Congregation set up specifically for this task: to find the enemies of the Church and destroy them. Decide for yourself whether the greatest threat to Rome is heretics, corruption or your family's rivals. Create offices The bureaucracy of the Papal States was full of recommended people with very little desire to work but who held high positions. Do not stop this tradition. Create useless but solemnly named positions and hire relatives, friends, and party companions. Obviously, positions with big names deserve big salaries... Manage bishoprics Even if you’ll never become Pope, this does not exclude you from running a state. Decide how to manage the resources of the state. Invest in good works or divert the money to you and your relatives. Will you be a good or a lousy administrator? Create a dynasty The greatness of the Church is a key objective, but your family comes first. Start as a priest in the most remote diocese and work your way up to become Bishop of Rome. Place your relatives at the top of the Papal States and make your heirs forget the word \"insignificance\". Remember, death stops the body, not the ideas: your family will still be there to carry out your plans. Fight Heresy The greatest threat to the integrity of the Church is Heresy. But are you sure it is really bad? You choose whether to persecute them mercilessly or join them to reform the Church. Manage relations with other kingdoms The Pope is not the only sovereign of Europe. Others are interested in getting involved in the affairs of the Holy See. Interact with the greatest courts of Europe. Defend the interests of the Church. Make agreements and ensure that all souls always remain under the wing of Rome. Change the laws God's law is not enough. Men must also follow the laws dictated by you. Taxes, length of sentence and regulations are only some of the things you will have to decide on. What is the proper penalty for taking a bribe? It depends on what guise you will be playing: champion of justice or corrupt opulent? Deal with processes In the end, God will judge us; in the meantime, there are the earthly courts. Remember: the law applies strictly only to enemies; for friends, it is interpreted.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1910610\n","Tags: Design & Illustration, Casual, Relaxing, Colorful, Stylized, Pixel Graphics, Cute, Puzzle, Simulation, Indie, Atmospheric, Singleplayer, 2D, Anime, Hand-drawn, Cartoony, Fantasy, Hidden Object, Magic, Family Friendly\n","Description: About This Game Pixel Artist is a relaxing PIXEL PAINTING game.

You have to be a manipulator of the main character, allowing him to survive the attacks of \"Entities\" for a total of two weeks. If him survives the game, he will be able to go up to the next floor and face another ordeal. In the game, you can never stand up until the end of the time limit and must survive using a camera. There are about 28 types of \"Entities\". They will attack or interfere with you in different ways. \"Entities\" are the things you see the most in this game and need to know the best. Their attacks are by no means simple, and you must be familiar with how to stop them to survive in this game. Some Entities look like humans, but they're all machines. Keep in mind, machines can only think and act within a set range. There are many ways to manage these Entities and stop attacks, but using \"cameras\" accounts for the highest proportion. The camera will allow you to manage Entities in four zones, but some of them will try to interfere with your camera use. \"Extra Entity\" is placed on each floor. These will make each floor feel different and help other Entities attack. The higher you go up the cellar, the higher your skills will be, and more Entities and more difficult difficulty will wait for you. This game is very difficult, and it's a series of trials, but never give up. Someone is waiting for you. * Since it's a oneman production, there might be some shortcomings in the story. *\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1912880\n","Tags: \n","Description: \n","\n","\n","App ID: 1912930\n","Tags: \n","Description: \n","\n","\n","App ID: 1913230\n","Tags: Choose Your Own Adventure, Clicker, Casual, Interactive Fiction, Visual Novel, 2D, Cute, Relaxing, Conversation, Text-Based, Indie, Anime, Singleplayer\n","Description: About This Game A Visual Novel prequel to the upcoming WifuBox!

You have to collect and farm creatures, various bizarre creatures, to further develop your territory and eventually defeat the evil force that has been organizing against you throughout the game. Depending on the playthrough, various creatures can be acquired and farmed, many of which have unique characteristics. By purchasing these creatures you can gain resources (energy). You can use the energy to upgrade walls, lasers, mines and a wide range of other defensive equipment. The game has a passive development system, your repertoire of tools will evolve in whatever direction the system deems useful to you. And what are these defences against? Against mould, which, like an infection, overwhelms and destroys the living things the player builds. In other words, there is no archvillain, some being above all. You simply have to repel and eventually defeat the attacks of the mould that constantly besieges the night. Storytelling about the fate of the game: As a result of experimental development that started back in 2018, a game software called \"Memetric demo\" was visible and playable on a small game sharing site, which reached version 1.3, but was removed after 2020 due to an internal decision of the development team. Since then, this game was nowhere to be found officially and seemed to be lost forever. Now, at the end of 2022, CloudCage who own the rights to this game decided it was time to override the mistake made in 2020 and give players back a slice of the deepindie market they thought was lost. Sadly, while it's not quite the same game, we've done our best to bring back as much of the feel as possible and add enough extras that don't take away from its early charming immaturity. This game has been recreated from the original 2018 code. It includes the earliest 1.0 version of the ingame \"item unlock\" system, includes all of the creatures from version 1.1, all of the secrets and camera views from version 1.2, and some of the visuals from version 1.3. But it also includes new features, building and gathering mechanics never seen before in this version. \"Holovision\" elements and popup button markers to make the game easier to play. Background elements to clarify your own area. Lots of options compared to the original game, including difficulty setting. So, in a few words: both graphically and mechanically improved, you could say this could be the 1.4 version of the game that never existed. We made sure it wasn't perfect. We didn't want to erase the original unpolished charm of the game, so we didn't fix every little bug, delete shortcut parts and \"hammer every protruding nail\". We believe that the small, now perhaps defunct, but resurgent audience of gamers who were deprived of this game loved it for what it was, and we intended to give it back to them. That's why we want to say that while minor patches to fix the bugs in this new version will be coming, and the game's optimization will improve over time; BUT the gameplay will not change! We won't change things in it that will make it stop being the game it is after months or years. It's a tribute to a not so ancient but closed era, to developers who loved this game and did their best for their tiny target audience, to players who lived, spent and played every little update of this game. To everyone who ever loved the Memetric demo!\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1915210\n","Tags: Indie, Puzzle, Atmospheric, Platformer, 2D, Singleplayer, Adventure, Relaxing, Exploration, Time Travel, Mystery, Surreal, Action, Dark, Minimalist, Physics, Quick-Time Events, Difficult, Puzzle Platformer\n","Description: About This Game A time distortion beyond our character's control, who discovers some kind of dimensional machine, they find themselves in a familiar but another time place.

You have to be careful who you talk to as you try to survive in a 12person bar with mafias, customers and neutral. Can you talk to the different people you sit at the table in each round and convince them you're on the good side? You can play the Bargue game online with a group of 12 friends or with random players. Thanks to the voice chat infrastructure of the game, you can talk with the players ingame and try to persuade them by speaking. At the beginning of the game, do not forget to choose which language you will play the game, or you may find yourself in a game where a different language is spoken :) You must stick to the role assigned to you at the beginning of the game. As a doctor, you can heal yourself or you can heal other players, while as a detective, you can see what is going on in the game. You can add some excitement to the game as the owner of the place, and you can enjoy your gold with the rich role. You have to be careful not to get killed by the mafias and not to lose your money to the thief! If you are in the role of a customer, do not be sad, you can make the game more fun by using your gold in different features! At the beginning of each game, you will have a certain amount of gold. You can spend these golds according to the features of your role. You can save your gold for the next rounds, or you can use your gold immediately. Do not forget that the more rounds you do not spend your gold on skills, the more money you have. Unless you lose your gold to the thief 🙊 So, how you use your gold is entirely up to you :) We can divide the roles in the game into three categories. These categories are neutral, customers, and mafias. Our neutral role is the thief. As a thief, your main goal in this game is to reach a certain amount of gold until the game is over. How will you achieve this? You can save your money for a few rounds if you want, or you can try to steal other players' money for some gold. But unfortunately, it's a matter of luck whether you can steal the money or not. So you can try to find the rich in the game and when you sit with them, you can steal their money :) As customers, you must understand who is the mafia and try to get the mafia out of the bar. Customers consist of the doctor, the detective, the rich, the owner of the place and regular customers. If you are a doctor , you must use your powers at the right time and try to protect the customers from the mafia who are trying to poison them. Or you can bring back some player to the life that you believe is good by saving a few rounds of money. If you are a detective , you can use your powers to figure out who the mafias are. You can use your gold to see what has been ordered on the tables, or you can use it to learn the role of someone you believe is bad. If you are rich , you should choose carefully who to give your money to. You can give your money to the doctor and help them to protect the customers. If you are the owner of the place , you can find the mafias and use your money to kick them out of the bar. If you cannot decide who is bad, you can choose to sit with that person for the next round and try to figure out if she/he is a customer or a mafia (or thief :). As the mafia, your goal is to get the dominance at the bar. You can use your gold to poison customers or the thief. But you can also try to persuade the neutral thief and take it to your side :) You can chat among other mafias with mafia chat. Thus, you can decide what kind of strategy you will adopt together. But one of the mafia’s say is more important. Who? The Godfather. Yes, you read it right, of course, you have a mafia boss, and the final decision is her/his. What happens if the godfather dies? Another mafia takes over the role of the godfather. So you keep trying to dominate the game. Now you know most of the things. You can learn the rest from the information part of the game. You can get one step closer to winning by developing new strategies while playing. After that, the ball is in your court. Can you persuade your opponent by speaking so that you will not be one of the players who are thrown out of the bar by voting at the end of each round? Let the good one win, or should we say the bad one 🙄\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1924440\n","Tags: Simulation, Casual, Sandbox, Farming Sim, Collectathon, Immersive Sim, 3D, Third Person, Realistic, Satire, Nature, Funny, Relaxing, Score Attack, Futuristic, Modern, Controller, Management, Tutorial, Open World\n","Description: About This Game The main character comes to work parttime at a ranch and takes care of 16 Holstein cows and their calves. He has to chase the cows with his dog, milk the cows, feed them, and carry the milk in buckets slowly without spilling. You can also take a car to explore and talk to the villagers. Together with the owner, breeders, veterinarians, and industrial technicians, you will make the farm prosperous. If there is too much feces, the ranch will be shut down if the animals get sick. Also, this hero sometimes loses motivation to work. At such times, sleeping well at home and drinking milk directly from the cows will increase his motivation. It is necessary to avoid submitting a letter of resignation. The nomadic call of “khoomii\" can be used to gather grazing cattle. The pasture has a thermometer and a clock to indicate the time. Hungry cows begin an abnormal behavior called tonguerolling, in which they stick out their tongues, curl them up, and lick them. The values from the veterinarian's blood test can be viewed on a smartphone to know the values for each individual cow. Also, stressed cows have high levels of adrenocortical hormone, which can be reduced by having their backs scratched with a machine called a cow brush, but you have to pay 25 credits in game money to the engineer.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1924510\n","Tags: Action, FPS, 3D, Shooter, Sci-fi, Futuristic, Modern, Sniper, Space, PvP, Combat, Inventory Management, Physics, Score Attack, Team-Based, Multiplayer, Online Co-Op, Free to Play, Singleplayer, Indie\n","Description: About This Game A semi scifi online PVP FPS shooter game with multiple maps, various weapon categories to master, incredibly fast paced movement with cool futuristic jetpack and jumppads around the map.

The Franchise Hockey Manager series returns for the 202223 season with plenty of new additions to the deepest, most authentic hockey strategy gaming experience you can find. Choose one of dozens of leagues around the world and select a team to guide to glory, including a chance at the ultimate prize: FHM 9 is licensed by the NHL®, allowing you to take the reins of your favorite franchise to capture the Stanley Cup®.    Take control of a national team and try for international supremacy.  Choose a historical game, where you can begin in any year in  NHL® history right back to the beginning in 1917, or play in a legendary international tournament.   Or if you'd like to create your own customized league, you can do that as well!  Or if you've been playing FHM8 and can't bear to part with your team, import the save into FHM9 and carry on with the addition of FHM9's new features. However you choose to play, you have control of your team and can oversee finances, select strategies, hire your staff, make trades, sign free agents, and draft the newest generation of stars as you try to build a championship team  and then make it into a dynasty! All new for Franchise Hockey Manager 9 College hockey is here!  American college teams are now playable, allowing you to run one of over 60 Division I teams.  Since college hockey has some unique challenges, we've added a number of special mechanics to college team management, including a unique player recruitment system, details like managing scholarships and academic eligibility, qualification for the postseason tournament, and more. Injury Deferral: you can now choose to defer injury treatment for some types of injuries until after the season ends.  That will let you keep the injured player in the lineup with reduced performance and a risk of making the injury worse.  That will allow you to keep the player in the lineup for key games at the end of the year or in the playoffs, but you'll need to balance that against the possibility of getting the player healthy as soon as possible.  And the impact of serious injuries on a player's ratings has been beefed up, so major injuries now have a bigger chance of derailing a player's career. The team harmony system has been completely redesigned: \"problem\" players will now potentially create many more headaches for their General Manager, who'll have to keep a careful eye on their team as office incidents can lead to player conflicts and the formation of divisive factions that can send player morale plummeting. New AllStar Games: we've added allstar games (in multiple formats) to leagues outside the NHL, as well as older formats (like the defending champion playing the rest of the league's allstars) for the NHL in historical mode. International play in historical mode has been expanded with the addition of the World Junior Championships tournaments, allowing you to replay all the historical tournaments going back to 1974. Bonuses can now be included in player contracts, using the the real NHL bonus mechanics. Historical mode now includes preset injuries and suspensions, so players who were injured or suspended at the beginning of your first season will begin the game like that  no more unrealistically 100% healthy lineups. 2D mode has received some improvements, including the addition of some setplay mechanics, particularly on the power plays, so you can see your offensive tactics unfolding as you intended.  We've also introduced some new internal mechanics to make player movement look a little more smooth and natural. We've made a number of interface improvements, particularly on the player screens, to make data easier to find with fewer clicks, and fix some omissions and inconsistencies. The Tactics screen will now provide much better feedback on whether or not the players in your lineup (or individual lines) are a good fit for your chosen tactics. Trading now includes a \"Make this Work\" option that will instantly tell you which player(s) you can add to a deal to get the opposing general manager to accept it. Players with No Trade and No Movement clauses now have individualized lists, displayed with their contract data, of which teams they're willing to waive their clause for, allowing them to be traded. Traded draft picks can now be given Protected status, which will defer the pick to the following season if it's higher than a specified level  so you can trade away your first rounder but be secure in the knowledge that you won't have thrown away the #1 overall pick if your season ends in disaster.  Of course, Protected picks won't be worth quite as much as a regular one... The AI will now more actively seek to trade its players if they're holding out for a new contract.  Additionally, it will also weigh players' office attributes more heavily when evaluating their trade value  teams may now be a little more reluctant to take a difficult player off your hands. Owner expectations will now be a little more detailed, including a longterm outlook that will give you an idea of how the owner sees the team progressing next season.  The season outlook mechanics for AIrun teams have also been upgraded, allowing the team to go into a more aggressive WinNow or Rebuild modes. World Championships roster AI has been adjusted to reflect the large number of players, particularly Canadians and Americans, who opt not to participate in the tournament.  So, the Canadian and American teams will no longer dominate the tournament with a group of allstar NHLers. Some improvements have been made to stat presentation in player histories and popups: histories now include seasonal averages over the course of the player's career, and the popups show stat projections for the current season. Player who have been recently acquired now have a 60day cooldown period before the \"shop player\" option can be used for them. All staff in a league can now be released at once on the League Edit screen (in addition to the existing option to release all players.) The rule that attaches temporary nomovement clauses to players acquired via waivers can now be deactivated in the game options. KHL players can now buy out their own contracts if they get an NHL offer, making them easier  but potentially more expensive  for the NHL teams to sign. In addition to all of that, there are the usual large variety of smaller and internal changes, tweaks, database changes,  and interface improvements!\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1937550\n","Tags: Action, Arena Shooter, FPS, 3D Platformer, Parkour, PvP, Platformer, Shooter, 3D Fighter, First-Person, 3D, Team-Based, Controller, Sci-fi, Score Attack, Robots, Futuristic, Multiplayer, Free to Play, Combat\n","Description: About This Game Overstike Arena is a fastpaced FPS competitive multiplayer game in 2 versus 2.

And you're ready to be immersed in a French speaking world of adventure? Then take control of Pierre as he travels across the kingdom, solving puzzles, making friends and defeating monsters. His journey to save the princess mirrors your journey into learning French! Pierre's Adventures in French is designed to be entirely in French with no ingame translations and will be useful regardless of your native language. All interface, dialogue and narration is in simple French accompanied by carefully designed images and animations to help you understand the game play and objectives. This is not a classroom, there are no quizzes or word matching exercises. The purpose of this game is to provide a fun but challenging environment for you to practice and learn through immersion.  Just how we learn our native languages! FEATURES Dozens of unique characters fully voice acted by native French speakers Autosaved progress and no death mechanic encourages experimentation without risk Over 4000 lines of ingame French dialogue Approximately 1020 hours of game play (depending on experience level) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS \"Is this game for beginners?\" No... *unless* you're very serious about learning French through immersion, enjoy a challenge, and are willing to learn as you go. This game is particularly useful for people who have a very basic level of French and want to put what they're learning into practice while improving their vocabulary. You'll get the best results if you spend a few weeks or months learning the basics before starting this game. If you're looking for a beginner friendly game then you may be interested in \"Linguist FPS\". But for those that already have a basic level of French then Pierre's Adventures is a much more comprehensive and useful experience. \"How is this different to just playing any regular game in French?\" Games with language simple enough for beginners typically don't require much language comprehension to play. (Eg: most action platformers.) And narrative driven games have a lot of dialogue which is too advanced for learners. It's also rare to find those games with full audio dialogue transcribed into other languages. Pierre's Adventures uses simple language designed for beginners and accompanied by helpful imagery. That said, we would recommend that you try playing some of your favorite RPGs in French. If you are able to understand all your objectives then congratulations! Your French is already quite excellent. \"Everything is in French without translation? Won't I feel overwhelmed?\" Sometimes, yes! But don't be discouraged, you can absolutely complete this game even if you don't understand every word that's being said. If you can persevere you'll find that you're still able to understand your objectives and how to achieve them. New language learners often find themselves quite overwhelmed when first attempting to interact in the language they’re studying. This is a natural part of the process. Just watch for keywords and context, and don't be afraid to experiment! \"Will you be releasing this game in other languages as well?\" We have released \"Pedro's Adventures for learning Spanish\" and \"Peter's Adventures for learning English\". If there is sufficient support then we intend to release it for other languages starting with German, Russian and Japanese. \"Will it be available on other platforms? (macOS, Android, consoles etc)\" Initially it will only be available for Windows PC, but if there is sufficient demand for it then down the track we'd love to port the game to macOS, Linux, consoles and mobile devices. A WORD FROM THE CREATORS Pierre's Adventures in French is one of many resources you should use when learning a language and is particularly useful for learning common nouns, verbs and pronunciation. We recommend playing it in conjunction with resources that focus on teaching the nuances of grammar and verb conjugation. ROCKET BOY GAMES is an independent games studio with the objective of providing fun alternatives to your language learning experience. With enough support we hope to create a variety of language learning games for French along with other languages. We hope you will be part of that journey. Bonne chance !

Dungeoneer is intended to play at a slightly slower pace than most action RPG games, aiming to reduce button mashing while being visually appealing and immersive. Combat is heavily inspired by Runescape and World of Warcraft, where ability rotation and stat optimization heavily influences gameplay.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1951950\n","Tags: Utilities, Controller, 3D\n","Description: About This Software A 3D controller overlay for streamers.

Yet you are all the cogs. There is no end and no beginning. Only computation. There are only a handful of base components to master. Clone replicates a token. Filter redirects a zero or Nul token to another path. A lock will not allow a token through until it has been unlocked from the side. Switch directs tokens left or right, which can be selected by supplying a token at the other end. Increment and decrement units add or subtract one from the token. And finally a nullifier converts a zero to a Nul and viceversa. All other units in the game are ones made by you. User Interface The design interface has plenty of quality of life features making construction as painless as possible.

This is Chapter 1 in a sixchapter game. One day, every employee of Marsh Industries seemingly vanished. Unable to penetrate the stateoftheart security system, police have asked The Agency for help. You're called in on a oneman mission to rescue any survivors, neutralize any threats, and retrieve the experimental AI brain Marsh has developed. What happened to the employees? Who is responsible? And what madness has this company created? Find tools and solve puzzles to advance further into the labyrinthian laboratory.  You were sent in with a gun and a flashlight. That won't nearly be enough equipment to combat the dangers you'll be facing. Not even close.  Thankfully, this lab is wellstocked with everything an intrepid adventurer needs to stay healthy and continue breathing, including a crowbar, a spray bottle and a screwdriver. Better pick up everything you can carry!  Unfortunately, all of these things and more are required to find your way through the locked and occasionally boobytrapped maze of doors and corridors that make up the Marsh building. Read the notes of survivors, the last emails sent before the disaster, and the bizarre bloody messages smeared across the walls.  Check the computers in case the emails sent on that fateful day hold a clue. And maybe you'll find schematics for the AI brain you were sent to retrieve.  Discover the terrible fate of those waiting to be rescued. Are any still alive? Will you find and rescue them or only find heartbreak?  And what to make of the messages written in blood. Why would anyone choose to communicate this way and what exactly are they communicating? Do you have the knowledge, quick wits and fast reflexes to navigate the horrors awaiting you in this hightech nightmare?  It won't be enough to simple figure out the solution to a problem. You might need to rely on your extensive education to find the answer.  But even that might not be enough. As an agent you have sharpened your wit into a deadly weapon and you'll need to access it quickly in order to survive.  The dangers lurk around every corner and they are both visible and hidden. A twitchy trigger finger and a solid grasp of your abilities will be key. Or will you lose your mind venturing through the darkened, bloodsoaked corridors, and take your anger out on every destructible object around you?  There WILL be times when you won't know what to do and you'll feel the walls closing in on you making the hairs stand up on the back of your neck.  Will you keep a level head and a calm composure when under this immense pressure? Or will you let off steam in an orgy of violent destruction?  Thankfully, there are plenty of every day objects littering this hellscape that are just waiting to be smashed, bashed and demolished. But better not make too much noise. They WILL hear you and they WILL find you, there in the dark, behind that door, hiding in the shadows.  Destruction might make you feel better but it could also make you feel deader. As in, like a doorknob (which you probably broke off with your crowbar).  They can hear the noises you make and it'll draw them to you like moths to a flame. That is, if moths could stab you, shoot laser beams or electrocute you.  Even the darkness is no cover. They have infrared eyes. Your only hope is to find a hiding place and pray they don't see you. And stay quiet. Will you survive? Or will you discover the only path takes you deeper and deeper into the realm of robotic insanity?\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1954880\n","Tags: Strategy, Creature Collector, Tower Defense, LEGO, Multiple Endings, Stylized, Singleplayer, Indie\n","Description: About This Game 1.

As graduates of Art and Technology, we aim not only to showcase our design achievements but also to convey our profound understanding and unique perspectives on this era. The theme of our graduation exhibition, \"Facing the Future, Creating the Future,\" is a response to the current Intelligent Revolution. The exhibition is divided into three major sections: Art and Intelligent Technology, Art and System Technology, Art and Display Technology. Through these sections, we delve into intelligent principles, material elements, and interactive experiences in the digital information realm, guided by artificial intelligence and big data. We conduct indepth artistic experiments based on \"design humanities\" in the field of intelligent and systematic art. Our research goals focus on technological innovations and artistic creativity in intelligence and systems, encompassing areas such as intelligent services, system design, and digital information practices, paving the way for future integration of art and science. Amid the wave of the Intelligent Revolution, we recognize the significant potential of highway service areas as crucial nodes in intercity transportation. Currently, many service areas face challenges in resource utilization, information integration, and service enhancement. Therefore, we have designed an intelligent management system for highway service areas in the era of the Internet of Things. Centered around intelligent decisionmaking, optimized management, and enhanced services, this system integrates vast amounts of data to achieve interconnectedness and support rational decisions made by intelligent systems. We have thoroughly studied management needs and designed an Internet of Things digital twin system to promote intelligent management in service areas. Simultaneously, we have also considered traveler needs, optimizing travel processes and creating a more comfortable and convenient consumption environment. A key aspect of this design is the intelligent decisionmaking module, which aids consumers in making comprehensive and reasonable travel plans during their journey to the service area, effectively balancing the needs of various participants within a complex system. Another focal point is the digital twin console, tailored to the operational needs of the service area, addressing the challenges of managing complex systems. Through this design, we aim to provide a solid foundation for the digital development and AIdriven decisionmaking of highway service areas, while reducing management costs, improving efficiency, enhancing operational conditions, and offering travelers a superior and convenient service experience. We believe this design will bring more possibilities to the economic development of highway service areas and serve as a platform for graduates of Art and Technology to showcase their talents and contribute to society.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1956400\n","Tags: Action Roguelike, Bullet Hell, Roguelite, Action, Arcade, Roguelike, 2D, Character Customization, Controller, Choices Matter, Pixel Graphics, Fantasy, Combat, Singleplayer\n","Description: About This Game Kill as many enemies as you can and try to get a good position on the online leaderboard. 10+ different upgrades to automate your character 20+ different enemies that really wants to kill you 20+ different upgrades to make your own unique build PISTOLA is a roguelike topdown shooter where you can buy upgrades to make your pistol stronger.

I believe this game could inspire many others, there are a lot of possibilities with the 'mosaic' approach.\"  Richard Garfield Madcap Mosaic is a roguelike tiledrafting/deckbuilding game. It takes the cards out of your hand and puts them on the table. Your deck is now the board, and you move your avatar across the board using your tiles as you go. This drastically changes the gameplay and sets it apart from other games of the genre. Classic mechanics of the genre are warped or replaced entirely, and what's left is a game in a genre lots of us love that manages to find its own special niche. A random selection from the 170+ unique tiles forms a tile Lattice each game. Rather than choosing from 3 random tiles each battle, you'll return to this Lattice and branch out to reach farther tiles. This is the drafting segment, and it is a mix of skilltree, deckbuilding, and drafting. Seeing your options, determining your path, and knowing when to adapt is key! After selecting new tiles, you bring your Mosaic to the next battle and put it to the test. Bolstered by 2 random traits each run (out of a pool of 80+), you'll need to come up with a plan and execute it if you want to survive the gauntlet of monsters. There are many strategies to discover, experiment with, and push to their limits. A wide variety of unlockable tiles, traits, and aesthetic options reward your success, open up new strategies, and deepen others.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1965840\n","Tags: Story Rich, Walking Simulator, Adventure, Satire, Surreal, Colorful, Physics, First-Person, Stylized, 3D, Exploration, Interactive Fiction, Platformer, Puzzle, Visual Novel, 3D Platformer, FPS, Puzzle Platformer, Linear, Simulation\n","Description: About This Game What does it mean to be?

In this turnbased strategy game, you will control the armies, research, production and diplomatic policy of either the Union or the Confederacy during a time of great innovation and dramatic battles. Your decisions will determine whether the United States leaves this conflict as one nation or two. What are your orders, Mr President? A BRAND NEW BATTLEFIELD Strategic Command: American Civil War comes with a massive 66,000 hex map, covering all of North America from Canada and New Mexico to the Caribbean at a 15km/9mi scale. This is the largest hexbased map ever offered by the Strategic Command series! COMMAND YOUR ARMIES With few professional soldiers ready to fight at the beginning of 1861, building an army will be just as important as ordering your men into battle. Thousands of volunteers are enlisting, and you will need to organise them into Brigades, Divisions and eventually Corps. Research will have to be undertaken to improve their weaponry and fighting skills. Once their training is complete, you will be able to choose from a variety of famous Generals to lead them, including Lee, Jackson, Grant, McClellan, Beauregard and Sherman. With the fate of entire armies hinging on single battles, the appointment of talented Generals may well be the difference between victory and defeat. RIVER WARFARE The great rivers of North America, including the Mississippi, Ohio and Cumberland, can now be navigated by allnew river warships, with inland ports offering the opportunity for rapid movement, and their waters bringing the danger of amphibious attack. THE AGE OF THE IRONCLAD The war on the high seas has also been expanded, with ships now divided into rivercraft, coastal and seagoing vessels, and wooden and ironclad construction. With the most diverse roster of warships ever offered by a Strategic Command game, your admirals will have more opportunities than ever before to achieve victory at sea. RECONNAISSANCE REWORKED The fog of war has never been more important in shaping your success on the battlefield, as the lack of radio communications means that cavalry will be essential to locating enemy armies and avoiding ambush. Infantry scout detachments, partisan rangers and armoured trains can also be trained to expand the recon capabilities of your armies, while Generals willing to use experimental technology will have the opportunity to use observation balloons, taking the war to the skies. EUROPEAN INTERVENTION Diplomatic action, battlefield success and decision events such as the sale of the Confederate Cotton Stockpile or the Emancipation Proclamation will determine whether the European Great Powers intervene in the Civil War. The UK, France and Spain can all be persuaded to support the Confederate cause, and their entry could greatly alter the war’s outcome. WAR IN MEXICO As the Civil War divides the United States, the French Emperor Napoleon III is engaged in another battle for control of Mexico. The front lines in America’s southern neighbour will be constantly changing, and if France should enter the war, players will be able to take up the flag of the Republic or the Empire as the Civil War grows into a conflict to determine the fate of all of North America! ...AND MUCH MORE! Using an enhanced version of the engine used by our WWI and WWII games, American Civil War also incorporates all of the muchloved features from previous titles in the series, ensuring that a great gaming experience awaits series veterans and new recruits alike! FEATURES 6 campaigns covering the Civil War from first shot to last: 1861 Blue and Gray 1861 Manassas to Appomattox 1862 Scott’s Great Snake 1862 Trent War (Alternate History: What if the UK recognized the Confederacy?) 1863 Lee Rides North 1864 Make Georgia Howl New unit types, including Balloons, Rangers, Monitors, River Gunboats and many more! New technologies, including Naval Engines, Ironclads, Skirmishers and the Field Telegraph. Riverine warfare is now possible, with waterways that can be navigated by 3 types of river vessel. Official mods have been included with the game, allowing players to choose between two brand new map styles and the \"classic\" style used in our previous games. The game also comes with an Editor that will enable you to make your own campaigns or mods. Coastal and inland fortress defences play a much greater role in Civil War strategy, guarding many key ports and waterways. Built before the war, their locations are known to both sides. Deactivating Partisan scripts, historical event popups and the European intervention mechanic now requires only a single event to be disabled.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1966170\n","Tags: Early Access,

In the Beginning was the Nothingness... Enter the Unknown, explore the Infinite, find your own SenS. SenS is a game about exploring and solving the mysteries of the Structure. Ideas and thoughts, simple words or dramatic stories, complex systems, hypnotic sounds, confusing memories and labyrinthine buildings... The Structure can take many shapes for exploring and interacting with it. But what is the Structure? How to understand it? How could you not have lost yourself and your mind while diving into its infinite depths?

But what would have happened if the Manhattan Project has failed or known such delays that the bombs could not be made ready in time? Operation Downfall was the codename for the Allied plan of invasion of the Japanese home islands. The operation had two parts: Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in November 1945, Operation Olympic was intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū, with the recently captured island of Okinawa to be used as a staging area. In early 1946 would follow Operation Coronet, the planned invasion of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo, on the main Japanese island of Honshu. Airbases on Kyūshū captured in Operation Olympic, and possibly other captures on nearby Shikoku, would allow landbased air support for Operation Coronet. If Downfall had taken place, it would have been the largest amphibious operation in history. Japan's geography made this invasion plan quite obvious to the Japanese as well; they were able to accurately predict the Allied invasion plans and thus adjust their defensive plan, Operation Ketsugō, accordingly. The Japanese planned an allout defense of Kyūshū, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations. Casualty predictions varied widely, but were extremely high. Depending on the degree to which Japanese civilians would have resisted the invasion, estimates ran up into the millions for Allied casualties In this game you will be able to experience the two landing and the overall amphibious assault against the Japanese home islands in 1945 and 1946. The game scale is at division level for land units, wings for air units. Naval forces are abstracted and other special weapons such as Kamikaze or Midget submarines represented by events or the play of combat cards. Each region is about 100 square miles, and a turn represents 1 week of real time. Scenarios vary in length, for 10 to 27 turns. They will offer you various starting options (more troops, more replacements, more air support, different at start positions, airborne operations) that may alter the historical setup and offer vast replayability potential.  Soviet intervention in the operation, as planned against the northern island of Hokkaido is also included. And Japanese domestic politics, as well as the role of the Emperor and its protection from capture are also considered. The Japanese have very few mobile troops, armor, artillery and their planes are numerous but outmatched. But they have very strong fixed defenses, well organized and incredibly tough to break, as they account always for the difficult nature of the various terrains of the Japanese islands. They can count also on the loyalty and dedication of their population.  Their playing cards and events reflect this, plus the fierce nature of their defense. The Allied forces are well equipped, backed by a strong air force and impressive naval gunfire support, but their timeline and objectives are always very tight to meet, and in particular the need to secure harbors for supplies and airbases to ensure redeployment of tactical air support, all during a rather inauspicious time of the year and poor weather prospects. Those external constraints, but also various other assets, are covered by the diversity of the cards they have in hands. There were dozens of estimates on how the operation would unfold if it had been undertaken. All concur on Japanese stiff resistance and a huge level of casualties never seen before, a prospect that was potentially raising hell also at home on the US political front. Opposition between the Navy and the Army in the US was tense on the different aspects of the plan, as well as the means and weapons to be used. Another similar fierce fight existed inside the Japanese power circles between the proponents of the socalled Peace Faction and their adversaries willing to fight till the last of the millions of subjects of the Emperor. That battle would have been gigantic and of neverseen before proportions, no doubt! Would you like to try and explore the fight with SGS Operation Downfall? Estimated Playtime : 20h00+. Favored Side : none. Hardest to Play : USA.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1978850\n","Tags: Racing, Driving, Arcade, 2D, Top-Down, PvP, Local Multiplayer, Old School, Casual, 1980s, 1990's, Controller, Multiplayer, Split Screen, Third Person, PvE, Minimalist, Physics, Retro, Automobile Sim\n","Description: About This Game Remember those old console racing games we grew up playing on the small CRT boxes?

Among all the possible scenarios, being pulled apart and tricked by a demon is certainly not what Daphné and Luca were expecting. Awakened as a pure soul in a twisted world he doesn’t understand, Luca is trapped in the reality of Buer, a demon with ulterior motives. He will have to find his way back to Daphné and his own fleshy sheath, solving puzzles and using whatever he can to get back to his life: notes, books, spirits he will encounter, decor, and Buer's (partial) information. Goetia as a series is built on one cornerstone: in these pointandclick adventures, you act as a pure (kind of) living soul. And what happens when you do not have pockets? No inventory. Rack your brains and keep an open mind: everything can help, from the notes to the decor. Above all, your actions in some rooms may have consequences elsewhere. And there’s a lot of “elsewheres” in Venice – especially when it’s the demons’ version of it. Explore Venice More than 80 rooms to explore, each with its own atmosphere and challenges, divided into 5 areas to explore. From the old classic venetian mansions to the abandoned islands of the lagoon, you’ll uncover many secrets related to the art of summoning demons. No inventory Luca awakens as a pure spirit. How could he grab objects and keep them for later? Instead of the classic inventory system, Goetia is all about possessing objects to move them around. A wall? What wall? Spirits walk through walls, it is known. As well as ceilings and floors. There’s no place you won’t be able to reach, unless something (someone?) stops you. Or if you wander around possessing an object. Choose your path There are 5 different areas to explore in Goetia. You will start by the archives, and then make your way through various other places in Venice. When all areas are discovered, you can go back to any room, anytime, to solve puzzles, gather more intel or just enjoy your walk freely. Get stronger During your quest, you will find some special capacities that will allow you to understand and see more of this strange Venice.

We Are Definitely The Baddies is a tiny game with just a bunch of buildings to choose from and one single resource. Each run lasts 15 minutes, but keep in mind this isn't a game you will be playing for hours. The emperor is kicking you out of the planet. But that should worry an evil space overlord such as yourself. Build a huge factory, extract resources, fend off the locals, and escape with all you can grab before the deadline. Create a network of pipes and factories that are likely to be terrible for the environment but great for your pockets. Simple city builder that won't overwhelm you. Great for a few short sessions. Yes, you only care about profit and you are evil.

Who is she? And who are you? And why are you both there? Case #1472 is mystery information digging interrogation thriller game where there are more things going on than what meets the eye, but are you able to unravel what has happened? Premise * There is a knock at the door, and someone enters the room. *  Mrs. Emma Hollis, I presume? My name is Simon. I’m here to interview you about the recent events you were involved in.  Shall we begin with an easy question? What you are supposed to do Imagine you enter a room and there is a mysterious woman sitting in front of you. The lightning in the room is so poor you can hardly see her face. Who is she? As the player starting up this game for the first time, you truly will not know anything about the situation you've been thrown into. Try and ask her questions (anything that you might find would be useful to ask) in order to see if you can understand what is going on. Begin with an easy question and see where you go from there. This game has no clear end Unlike other games, this game has no clear definition of end. The premise of the game is that you are interrogating a mysterious woman. You can ask her any question as you wish and she will respond (to the best of her abilities). But how many questions you need to ask, which questions you need to ask and what information you are suppose to find is not clearly defined for you. If you feel like you have done a good job with the interrogation, simply end the game and walk away. However, the question you need to ask yourself is though, did you truly understand what is going on or did you miss something? We created the game deliberately like this, as we wanted the game to be purely investigatory driven by the player. Any information you find and extract is solely thanks to your own imagination of asking questions and interrogating her. We also wanted this game to be a social cooperative experience. For example, you might play this game for while and then challenge or compare your findings with a friend. Did you both figure out the same information? Maybe you both unraveled two different key information and if you piece them together you both now understand the bigger picture? Seeing that there is no clear end to this game, we encourage cooperative and information exchanging among friends, as well as on other discussion forums and platforms. Game mechanics and features This is an information digging interrogation game where the player may type and ask the woman any question they wish If she knows the answer she will respond to the question, otherwise the player will get a dismissive answer The game automatically collects all asked questions by all the players in order to slowly improve over time The game has no clear end so the player can decide when to end the game at any time Achievements Custom made YouTube safe music soundtrack Thank you for play testing this game, your feedback is important! We want to explore the idea of creating an immersive mystery thriller interrogation game with a fully fleshed out and detailed story plot behind it. This is why we have published a working early version of the game in order to get as much feedback as possible! So if you have time, please give us feedback (good or bad) using the feedback button or on Steam  we would really appreciate it! However, even though this is an early version and we have a long list of things we want to improve and add (everything from thriller elements, better UI to professional voice acting, etc), there are more things going on than what meets the eye here...

Every enemy in the game requires a different approach to survive it and return to reality unscathed. In addition to imaginary creatures, the player can face threats in the real world and sometimes use a gun to defend himself. You can run, walk stealthily, crawl, interact with the environment and collect or examine items, read documents and use a flashlight to illuminate dark places. Arthur, the ragdoll, can help the player solve puzzles with clues and observations. The puzzles in the game are based on logic, research and memory.

You read letters, go to work, eat, shower, and watch entertainment on a telescreen called the Life Station. You're told the world beyond your four walls is crumbling. Carefully manage your time and resources to prevent the onset of insanity and investigate clues to discover what is really happening to you and everyone else.  Manage your energy, hunger, hygiene, bladder and sanity.  Dynamic day/night cycle.  Go to work and earn a paycheck.  Take that paycheck and manage it carefully, or gamble it all away.  If you do gamble it away, you can take out a loan, and hopefully learn your lesson. Or not.  Reach out and connect with pen pals who can write to you and help pass the time.  Do pushups in the morning to keep you fit.  Listen to the radio.  Receive packages from CentEx couriers.  Play actionpacked arcade games.  Shop at the mega popular online store.  Try your luck in the Mega Millions lottery. Congratulations on being chosen for Isolania, the last governing body of civilization. Here, you are sheltered from the outside, protected from the scourge that has decimitated the planet. I assume you understand the responsibility you are now charged with. Namely, to obey all the rules and regulations dictated within our city. As The Sadness spreads, Podders are reminded that the only cure against this scourge is to embrace Isolation. To combat feelings of loneliness, use your Life Station; it could save your life and those of your loved ones. Although we are blessed to live within the walls of Isolania, the world abroad hasn't been afforded the same grace. Globally, the plague has claimed an estimated six million lives. The Ministry of World Affairs has released a new report, citing that as many as 10,000 human lives are claimed every month. The population is dangerously low already...soon, there will only be us. Isolanians. Isolania should be viewed as a threedimensional visual novel. The story progresses through reading, and takes place (mostly) in a single room and can elicit feelings of intense isolation (unironically) . Playtime is expected to be between 1015 hours.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 1998110\n","Tags: Casual, Adventure, Shooter, FPS, 3D, First-Person, Atmospheric, Indie, Linear, Singleplayer\n","Description: About This Game Osirius Station  The State has lost contact with Osirius Station.

This simulator was created to give everyone an idea about the basic principles of sailing, as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator. 🔸 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave 🔸 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do 🔸 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses 🔸 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment 🔸 Have fun if learning is not your thing by exploring or competing 🔸 Venture on simple yet fun adventures 🔸 Collect Achievements and battle for the highest score ⚫ Currently available vessels are ◼ Laser  Olympic ◼ Catalina 22  Classic (Fin Keel) ◼ Sabre Spirit 37  (Fin Keel) ⚫ Current Sailing Features ◼ Keel Control ◼ Keel vs Vessel velocity & mass effect ◼ Boom Direction ◼ Boom Jibe & Tack forces ◼ Boom Vang Control ◼ Main Sail Folding & Unfolding ◼ Jib Folding & Unfolding ◼ Jib Sheet tension & Winch Control ◼ Spinnaker Control ◼ Sail Reefing ◼ Rudder vs Velocity control ◼ Rudder & Turning circle based on vessel mass ◼ Rudder reverse control ◼ Engine Fuel Capacity and Refueling Systems ◼ Outboard engine control ◼ Outboard engine Prop Walk effect ◼ Sail Drive Prop Walk effect ◼ Dynamic Wind ◼ Level Interaction ◼ Drift effect vs Sail direction ◼ Vessel Heel & Potential Capsize effects ◼ Jib and Main Sail \"Rudder Pull\" when used separately ◼ Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction ◼ Much more... I created SailSim to be accessible for Android as well as Windows. It is difficult to find a good compromise as far as graphics, to satisfy the Windows crowd. I know it could visually be better but then the work needed to integrate it on Android would be much larger so i found a Middle ground as far as visuals go to hopefully satisfy both sides. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn't matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. I however do spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where the vessels can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect). Every time i sail i always think or notice a small detail in how my own vessel behaves and try to add that to SailSim. Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do. Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself. I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :) I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine. ⭕ Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go. ✴ If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don't hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time. I do try to check everything before i publish a new update but no one is perfect and things do tend to slip my mind from time to time.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 2005000\n","Tags: RPG, Strategy RPG, Mystery Dungeon, Roguelike, Traditional Roguelike, Party-Based RPG, Turn-Based Strategy, Action, Action Roguelike, Action RPG, 2D, Colorful, Turn-Based Tactics, Tactical RPG, Pixel Graphics, Demons, Fantasy, Magic, Nature, Casual\n","Description: About This Game About This Game Traditional roguelike where you build your team to defeat stronger and stronger opponents.

Inspired by the great helicopter games of the 90s, Helicopter Gunship D.E.X is a \"simcade\" experience leaning more towards the simulation side rather than the arcade side. Controls have been optimised for GAMEPADS without sacrificing simulation options via a Sensor/Screen of Interest (SOI) plus modifier button system to expand the number of buttons available. However, controls can be easily remapped to other devices for those that have flight sticks, throttle controls or HOTAS setups Arcade or Simulation? You won't find any magically respawning missiles here! Instead you will find realistic weapon loadouts, a simulation level physics driven helicopter flight model and the usual targeting pods and RADAR systems you would expect in this type of game. However, these systems have been simplified to give the overall \"feeling\" of being in control of a helicopter gunship without the need to memorise hundreds of keys. Random Missions The main part of the game revolves around the random mission generator that allows you to define your own procedurally generated engagements which will never play out the same way twice. Mission types include Strike, SEAD, Search & Destroy, Recon, Transportation etc. Deployment Point System Each mission in Helicopter Gunship D.E.X utilises a deployment point system ensuring missions remain balanced and that older weapons and helicopters still have a role to play no matter what the mission involves. Key Points Fully playable from either 1st person in cockpit or 3rd person chase cam perspectives. Fully playable with a gamepad but also completely rebindable controls for HOTAS systems etc. Robust procedurally generated random mission generator allowing you to quickly get into the action. Multiple helicopter flight models ranging from Simple to Realistic that allows even novice helicopter pilots to get straight into the action. Places you in direct control of both flying the helicopter and using the various targeting systems to designate and destroy targets. Easy to get into but still difficult and rewarding to master. 3 distinct 40km x 40km terrains to fly over (Lush Desert, Norway & Central Libya). Weapons & Targeting Weapon load outs are based on real world helicopter capabilities and you will use the same kind of realworld targeting systems such as \"SACLOS\", \"Laser\", \"RADAR\" etc to detect, designate and destroy your mission targets. A slight departure from reality is that you, the pilot, will be in direct control of designating targets and firing weapons even in helicopters that have copilot/gunner positions. Your CP/G will aid in target identification and spotting targets visually. Weapon types and availability will depend on the \"ERA\" that your mission takes place e.g. Low Tech is roughly pre 1980s technology so expect to be using wired guided TOW missiles Modern Tech (not availble in Early Access yet) is approximately 1990s2000s technology so expect to be using laser guided missiles. High Tech (not availble in Early Access yet) is approximately 20002020+ technology so expect to be using RADAR guided missiles and advanced technology. Flyable Helicopters Currently there are now 6 main helicopters (Apache, Lynx, Gazelle, Viper, Kiowa Warrior & Hind) and most have several different versions. You can read more about the helicopters and their various versions here... The Blackhawk, Chinook, Mi8 & Cheyenne helicopters are now in production and planned for release further into Early Access with the final game slated to include a wide selection of both Western and Eastern gunships allowing you to fight for either BLUFOR or REDFOR teams.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 2012270\n","Tags: Singleplayer, Action, FPS, Score Attack, Psychedelic, Procedural Generation, 3D, First-Person, Stylized, Indie, Free to Play, Violent, Gore, Dark Humor, Demons, Capitalism, Comic Book, Combat, Dark Comedy, Action Roguelike\n","Description: About This Game A miserable existence at the lowest rung in life is not for you!

After decades of movies and video games speculating on a possible virus that turns humans into \"zombies\", it has happened. It all started with some strange viral videos on social media, where crazy people were seen biting others in public places. Afterward, the news began to talk about hospitals collapsing and mass hysteria that resulted in uncontrolled violence. A few weeks later, the first martial law was enacted, and frightened citizens locked themselves in their homes while authorities were attempting to contain an unprecedented social event. THREE DIFFERENT FACTIONS! On one hand, the powerful national armies are desperately trying to restore an order that now seems forever lost. On the other hand, there are the Infected or all those forms of life that have been infected by this mysterious living organism, which inexplicably seems to make intelligent choices in its actions. Finally, there are the Survivors: men and women forced to survive day after day, isolated inside the metropolis they used to call home. Each of these 3 factions has unique units, buildings, defenses, tactical and strategic supports! Take advantage of the Army's devastating firepower in the open field, assault the last human bulwarks by playing as the Infected... or try to survive at least another day as a Survivor. THREE DIFFERENT VIDEO GAME GENRES! Turnbased system: In Age of Undead, Campaigns are turnbased, giving you all the time you need to make critical strategic decisions. In each turn, you can recruit new armies, move them, start battles, build structures, call strategic supports, and take on side missions. Realtime strategy: Whether it's a quick battle or a campaign battle, it will be fought in full RTS style, letting you feel both the tactical responsibility and the oppressive presence of the enemy on the battlefield. There is the possibility to slow down the passage of time and pause the game to have a calmer and more complete picture of the battle. First Person Shooter: Although Age of Undead is primarily a strategic game, the developers wanted to broaden the gaming experience. Are you tired of managing hundreds of units and deciding everything yourself? There is no problem! Get comfortable and support your allies from above with some more or less conventional aircraft, hitting enemies relentlessly and opening the way for friendly troops! INNOVATIVE FEATURE! Finally, you can play as a \"bad guy\"  as an Infected  or as someone who has experienced the apocalypse firsthand  as a Survivor. 3 fully characterized factions with unique playstyles: the Army is great at mediumlong range, the Infected are unstoppable in close combat, and the Survivors try to dominate the battlefield with unconventional weapons. Day/night cycle (optional): the Infected will become more lethal at night, while humans will need artificial lighting systems to see through the darkness. If you don't want to play an RTS the traditional way, you can play it as an ally that helps by providing close air support, managing tactical support, or boarding powerful \"military\" aircraft. When a battle starts during the Campaign, it will take place in the same biome of the hex where the defending army is present. Armies can have specializations that significantly change players' and AI's playstyle. You can decide your allies' behavior before starting a battle to align their actions to your combat strategy. Some zombies and parasites can bring their victims back to life, so watch out for those killed in battle! There is a dynamic weather system (optional): random atmospheric events will take place in each biome, and that will heavily impact the battle. Buildings and strategic actions in the Campaign modify the player's experience when he goes into battle. If you surround an enemy on the Campaign map, you also surround him in battle! Clashes in RTS will fully reflect the conditions of the Campaign around the battle hex! Varied and easily manageable aviation. Use powerful air support to thin enemy ranks, but watch out for the costs! ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Battles can involve up to 6 armies (1 player + 5 bots). The number of units on the entire battlefield is customizable but depends on the power of your computer; in fact, it can vary from a few hundred to several thousand. Many game parameters are customizable to have a less frustrating and more suitable gaming experience. Different types of battles and different types of campaigns. The developers intend to increase the quality and quantity of the game modes, so the players' feedback is essential. Considering all the maps, battle types, factions, AI behaviors, their specializations, and their initial positions on the battlefield, Age of Undead tends to be much more replayable than other similar games. You can complete the Campaign by fighting very few battles manually; just knowing how to face an enemy by taking advantage of your numerical superiority is enough for victory!

His life is an ordinary one, but he’s content with it, even if he hasn’t had a girlfriend in years. Shouhei is happy enough to while away his days among stacks of old, dusty books, while chatting with his favorite (and only) colleague, the sweetnatured and mildmannered Asa… But his luck with women takes a sudden turn for the better when Asa asks him to go to the local gym with her, to help her shed some extra weight. While at the gym, Shouhei runs into two very different women: the haughty and aloof Tsumiki, and the cheerful, energetic Ranko, with whom Shouhei shares a complicated past. Join Shouhei as he helps Asa with her fitness regimen, all while trying to win over the icy Tsumiki and processing his feelings for Ranko. Whether Shouhei will end up with Asa, Tsumiki, or Ranko (or all three of them) is up to you in this visual novel. Characters: Asa works at Shouhei’s bookshop as his most trusted (and, indeed, only) employee. She’s a quiet girl with low selfconfidence, but her gentle smile ensures she always leaves her customers feeling satisfied. Asa is very short, which is something she’s horribly embarrassed about. She tries to counteract this by wearing heels, though she can’t help but envy popular idols and models for being so tall and willowy. She’s liked Shouhei for a long time, but she’s too shy to act on her feelings. Ranko used to be Shouhei’s girlfriend, back when the both of them were in university. They’ve since broken up, however, and Shouhei didn’t imagine he would ever see her again – that is, until he sees her at his local gym. Ranko is a cheerful, upbeat girl who doesn’t sweat the small stuff. She’s always smiling, laughing, and cracking jokes, which makes her fun to hang around with – though it can be hard to tell whether she’s being serious or not. Tsumiki is an aloof, haughty girl who acts like an aristocrat. She takes against Shouhei after their first meeting, and she’s aggressively rude towards him. Tsumiki might seem unapproachable, but she does have a sweet side. She’s a huge fan of romance novels, though she’s never been in a relationship before herself. She dreams about being swept off her feet one day by a handsome prince, and having her own happily ever after ending… But that’ll never happen, right?\n","\n","\n","App ID: 2018270\n","Tags: \n","Description: \n","\n","\n","App ID: 2018280\n","Tags: \n","Description: \n","\n","\n","App ID: 2018340\n","Tags: Action, Procedural Generation, Top-Down Shooter, Combat, Political, War, Shooter, Singleplayer, Top-Down, Realistic, Funny, Comedy, Dark Comedy, 3D, Dark Humor, Historical, Military, Female Protagonist, Parody, Foreign\n","Description: About This Game You are an ordinary mechanic, minding your own business in your hometown of Mariupol.

Imagine my heartbreak when I found out we've been playing roughly the same Soccer for like 200 years. In this game, all players are given cards while playing that they can use to change the rules of the game and change things up. \"Randomize the map, change the ball, strap ice cubes to everyone's feet LAUNCH EVERYONE WITH ROCKETS ADD 10 MORE BALLS RANDOMLY TELEPORT EVERYONE FINALLY SOME GOOD SPORTS!\" I cried to my parents as I ran up to my room at the ripe age of just 10. I hugged my stuffed dinosaur. Dino understands me. He would play my game. Maybe he can be the main character. Someday. In Soccer But Different, you play in a topdown circularshaped arena with goals on either side of the circle, one for each of the two teams. For 5 minutes, each player in the match will receive random Rule Cards which will change the game in some way for every player, the trick is when to use them properly. Some cards change how you interact with the ball, from grabbing or punching it, and other cards will strap rockets to everyone's back, boosting movement speed but lowering your control for a few seconds. Using the W, A, S, and D (or arrow keys) to move around and the Space bar (or left click) to interact with the ball, you will try to work with your team and all of the chaos around you to try and score the most goals before the time limit is up. To use Rule Cards, you can click them with your mouse (or use the 1, 2, and 3 keys). You can play Soccer But Different with up to 10 players (5 on each team) in a match by connecting to a host of a server through the lobby list anyone can host a server.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 2025780\n","Tags: Action Roguelike, Spectacle fighter, 3D Platformer, Souls-like, Hack and Slash, Martial Arts, 3D Fighter, Action RPG, Action-Adventure, 3D, Third Person, Parody, Action, Open World, Nonlinear, Cartoony, Assassin, Loot, Fantasy, Dog\n","Description: About This Game An open world dominated by cold weapons!

You can \"Sell\" items or use them for \"Alchemy,\" in which two or more items are combined to create a new item. ・ If you run low on energy during a dungeon, press the [Return] button to go home. You can bring back the items you acquired in the dungeon. Note that you cannot bring back items if your energy reaches 0. ・ Items can be refined through alchemy to make them even more powerful and valuable. Since powerful items make dungeon conquests much easier, be proactive about refining items. ・ Items and monsters have attributes. There are four attributes: None, Fire, Grass, and Water. The none attribute has no particular effect, but fire is strong against grass, grass is strong against water, and water is strong against fire. Properly accounting for attribute compatibility increases attack power and decreases damage received, so be mindful about the attributes of items you equip. ・ The game is cleared when all dungeons are traversed and liberated, and finally when the asset reaches 10 million gold.

I encourage anyone to do the same in their local area. *Headphones are crucial for beating some of the harder phases within Paresis's endgame. PARESIS ® takes place within a small house in the middle of nowhere. Here you will be faced with numerous challenges. GAMEPLAY You will have to survive 5 minutes to complete each Phase. In Paresis® you are surrounded by 4 rooms. These rooms will unlock throughout each phase and will have a new unique enemy you must encounter. In Paresis®, these enemies are called Morphs and they have their own positives and negatives. For example, one may be faster then another but they will have fewer hiding spots. On the other hand, you, the player, have zero movement and must use your lean and flame energy to survive the phase. However, each phase will become harder and you must undergo new obstacles. Once you complete a phase you will be able to make a choice between faster leaning speeds, or extra energy. Flame energy will scare away the Morphs and leaning helps you locate Morphs faster. HARDCORE MODE Hardcore Mode is obtained after you complete Paresis's main Phases. Completing the ending Phases within Paresis's main game can serve as a real challenge even for some of the best gamers. If you do beat the final Phase within Paresis®, you will unlock the option to play Hardcore. This adds even more challenge to the existing Phases but also changes up some gameplay elements as well. However, in this mode you will not be able to upgrade your lean speed or energy. This mode is targeted for anyone who wants the hardest challenge possible within a horror game experience. STORY Paresis® has plenty of lore for those interested in the game's story. If you beat a phase, you will be able to listen to radios that can help you understand more of the game's secrets. These radios are extremely important to the game's overall plot. Although, there are plenty of little easter eggs hidden about that also carry more of the game's overarching narrative. However, some things are better left unsaid. CHALLENGING Paresis is a very challenging game once you reach some of the ending phases. This will test your listening, logic, and timing skills. In order to beat these phases, you will have to dig deep and figure out what is the best strategy moving forward. Whether that is picking certain rooms to check at specific times or making sure you pick the right combination of lean and energy in order to survive.

However, they can move under shadows, such as inside old buildings or under thick trees that provide protection from the direct sun. Vampires come in several different classes.

They can only be killed with a strike to the multiple hearts they have on their body. AlphaVampires serve as miniboss fights. The Story So Far... Nobody really knows how the world changed so fast, but what we do know is that when the vampires came, mankind was driven behind the Night Gate. The Night Gate, and the walls that connect to it, surround the last human settlements. Little is known if the Night Gate was designed to keep the vampires out or to keep mankind in, like some kind of cattle ranch, but these are secrets that you will uncover in your quest to kill the master vampire, Lord Grendel! You play as Robin, a vampire hunter and a member of the Survivors Guild, who has been tasked with finding a way to penetrate the Night Gate, and destroy Lord Grendel before his horde of 10,000 ghouls breaches the walls. Gameplay Set in a giant swamp along the Mississippi River, the player has the freedom to go where they want on their Airboat. Players will need to keep an eye on the time of day, as vampires come out at night. Players will also have to hunt for food, as they can starve to death. The game is divided into two parts, the first part takes place inside the walls of the Night Gate, where players must find a way to stop Grendels army of 10,000 ghouls. This plays a lot like Majora's Mask where there is a time limit pressuring the player. The army of Grendel will arrive at the walls in roughly one game week (onehour irl). Players can do different tasks to extend this timer, but if the timer runs out, the players are treated to the \"dark ending\" of the game where they are put in a giant Lord of the Rings style battle against Grendels army on the walls of the Night Gate! If the player is successful in the first part of the game, the army timer is removed. The second half of the game takes place in Grendel Temple, which is a giant Metroidvaniastyle dungeon, where the player must use all the items and skills they have acquired to explore new areas and defeat giant bosses. Features Night Gate features classic RPG tropes. Filled with side missions and NPCs the player can talk to and interact with. Game mechanics such as \"hunger\" can be turned off. Full working Day/Night system. Powered by the latest graphics of Unreal Engine 5, players can explore the massive open world of the bayou.

Fighter jets, tanks, and battleships have entered the war, and giants known as Guardians and Mugen are tearing their way through the battlefield. This is the exciting stage of Akai Katana Shin, a horizontal shoot 'em up game. The Japaneseinspired military game visuals and gorgeous character designs portray a dramatic story of clashes between family and old friends. These elements are tied together by strategic game mechanics, which feature a wide variety of attack methods to experiment with. Find out for yourself why this game has such a strong base of ardent fans! Contains Three Titles From Cave's Akai Katana Series Akai Katana The first arcade game of the series released in 2010. Supports two players. Akai Katana Shin A home console version with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and new game features such as Hagane and Katana. Akai Katana Zetsu Based on Akai Katana with an aspect ratio of 16:9. Game mechanics have been adjusted for balance. From Strategy Crafting to Score Attack—Versatile Enough to Play It Your Way The player unit known as Fighter can switch between its normal form and a giant ninja known as Guardian using Soulshift. The unit also comes equipped with two different bullet shots. Attack Mode has more power and Defense Mode boosts mobility. Make good use of a combination of forms and modes to break through enemy ranks and destroy them. Soulshift is a crucial technique that boosts the player for a short while. In Akai Katana and Akai Katana Zetsu, timing the shift well can block enemy bullets even on a screen that's full of them. In Akai Katana Shin, generate and fire a Katana shot to quickly defeat strong enemies. The highlight of this title is the ability to negate or dispel attacks instead of simply avoiding them. Make good use of Soulshift to turn the tide in your favor and earn a higher score. Quality Game Modes Packed With Features Settings: Adjust options such as sound volume and screen display. Turn Screen Frame on to see captions for character voices during the game. Training: Specify a stage and adjust your unit's condition to carry out individual training. Score Attack: See how far you can go with only one life. No continues or restarts allowed. Rank and replays can be saved separately from normal gameplay. Online Leaderboard: See how your score compares against other players online. Replay: Record and save gameplay data from start to end of session. Other than playing and pausing the replay, you can also use the Edit function to jump right into the game from a specific point in time. Daisuke Matsumoto's New Soundtrack Masterpieces Daisuke Matsumoto, music composer of Gothic wa Mahou Otome and sound effects producer for the Akai Katana series, returns with exciting new musical arrangements for the game's soundtrack.

The goals and content of this bachelor's degree program are shaped by the current professional image of modern media informatics in the Web 2.0 environment. The course of studies offers students the opportunity to educate themselves in the field of designing creative content or creating informatic applications as they wish. In the fifth semester, all media informatics students of the class of 2016 developed Resonance in a development team of 40 students over a period of almost 4 months. This final project was presented to the public at beta, the university's inhouse games conference. We would like to thank our hardworking team leaders, our great project teams, our helpers, friends, family and everyone else who gave us patience, strength and trust along the way.

The rules are similar to mahjongg and poker, with a new tactical sense you'll love!

[Rules] The basic objective is a build stronger threecard hands than your opponent's. However, cards are dealt one at a time back each round. In addition, battles can progress simultaneously in multiple locations. As a result, the strategy is not so simple as building a single strong hand. \"My opponent's hand seems stronger here, so I'll give up this battle.\" \"I'll put together a hand that can just barely beat my opponent and hang onto my other cards.\" These are just some of the different tactics you can employ! (*Note: For more information about the rules, see the \"How to Play\" section  within the game.) You can also use \"special cards\" with unique effects to turn the tables! [Game Modes] Includes two different game modes, \"Naughty Mode\", which is a quick and simple game with more elements of luck, and \"Yakuza Mode\" which is a more advanced battle of wits challenge that requires more than luck alone to win! [Online Battle] Your opponent is another player somewhere in the world! This game offers unlimited battling against other players all over the world! It also features a cute cat stamp function for sending messages back and forth! [Rates and Rankings] Features a ranking system: win and your rank goes up, lose and it goes down!

There are two ways to win: spread your territory as far across the map as possible, building over enough \"winning tiles\" to collect the majority out of all other players; or play the offense/defense game and wipe out your competition. But if you aren't playing a balance of both you're bound to lose. This game is a yearlong labor of love accompanied by a thorough soundtrack from a project partner, so I hope this delivers!

You have found a camera with a footage in it. For some reason you can't rewind the video, and as soon as you try winding it forward you find yourself in the Backrooms. Figure out whats in the footage and try to ESCAPE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE! There are multiple levels and it seems impossible to escape, but dont give up! You have to get out of here! Linear space in Level 0 is altered drastically; it is possible to walk in a straight line, return to the starting point, and end up in a completely different set of rooms than the ones previously passed through. Due to this phenomenon, and the visual similarity between each room, consistent navigation of Level 0 has proven very difficult. Devices such as GPS locators and compasses fail to function within the level, and radio communications are audibly distorted and often prove unreliable. \"If you're not careful and noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of monoyellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum humbuzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in.

Story Utsushiyochigai It is a world that exists parallel to the present world in which we live, a world inhabited by gods and Yokai. It is a parallel world that was once connected to this world, another Japan. This story is a new generation Urashima Taro*, in which two girls confront yokai in order to solve the cursed beach incident in Utsushiyochigai! *Urashima Taro is a Japanese folktale. Prologue I. About the Utsushiyochigai Utsushiyochigai It is a world that exists parallel to the present world in which we live, a world inhabited by gods and Yokai. It is a parallel world that was once connected to this world, another Japan. The inhabitants of the two worlds have long held traditional festivals and events, and humans, gods, and Yokai have shared civilizations. However, with the passage of time, interaction with the Utsushiyochigai decreased and their culture became obsolete. Eventually, humans forgot their boundaries with the Utsushiyochigai and lost their relationship with the gods and Yokai. In this way, the gods and Yokai became a part of this world. Thus, gods and Yokai disappeared from our world and were treated as phantom beings. They are now treated as phantom beings. Ⅱ. About \"KIK” Setsuna is an office worker. Through a certain event, she meets the Yokai Tsukumo and is able to travel between the two worlds. Tsukumo is a clock Yokai and can use the power of \"Kokuikkoku(KIK)\" to manipulate time. Setsuna, too, has learned to use her Yokai powers through her encounter with Tsukumo, and has gained the ability to fight Yokai. Tsukumo is bored. Tsukumo offers Setsuna an interesting proposition. The two of them then go to Utsushiyochigai to exterminate Yokai, which is their daily routine. Ⅲ. The Beginning There is an abandoned house on a secluded beach in Utsushiyochigai. Once upon a time, there were many houses near this beach, and the area flourished as a fisherman's village. One day, however, a young man who went fishing suddenly disappeared. People gradually moved away from the beach, thinking it was the work of a terrifying Yokai, but the young man's family did not leave the beach and continued to wait for his return. In the end, however, the young man never returned home. One day, several hundred years later, an eerie voice could be heard coming from an abandoned house in the middle of the night. It turned out to be the family of the young man who had become a Yokai out of hatred for the sea that had kidnapped their son. Day by day, the voices grew louder and louder. The voices grew louder and louder day by day, and more and more Yokai began to appear on the beach. Soon, the sea became rough on many days due to the influence of the Yokai, and no one went out to fish. People were afraid and prayed to the gods for the Yokai to subside. Ⅳ. Beginning of Journey Having overheard the whole story about the incident on the beach, Tsukumo was gathering information in Utsushiyochigai. Tsukumo's preliminary investigation had led him to the existence of an abandoned house that had fallen into disrepair, but he did not know why it had fallen into disrepair. Back in our world, Tsukumo happily told Setsuna about the incident at the beach. \"Setsuna, I know you've been wanting to go fishing lately.\" Setsuna knew what Tsukumo was going to say. Setsuna says,\"What do you mean? I'm not interested in fishing.\" \"There are beaches where you can catch a lot of fish!\" \"Tsukumo doesn't want to go fishing, does he? Besides, I've never been fishing.\" \"Hmmm...then...maybe if you solve the case on the beach, the snapper and flatheads will dance for you!\" \"That would be Urashima Taro*. I'd rather eat fish than watch them dance.\" \"It would be more interesting if the fish danced.\" \"Calm down. Fish can't dance.\" \"Are you going? You're not going?\" \"Yes, yes. I'm going.\" They thought that there was a powerful youkai in the abandoned house, so they set out on another journey to Utsushiyochigai today.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 2095740\n","Tags: Action Roguelike, 2D, Action, Survival, Combat, Controller, Choices Matter, Top-Down, Fantasy, Indie, Casual, Singleplayer, Roguelite, Cute, Roguelike, Early Access, Arcade, Dungeon Crawler, Hack and Slash, Top-Down Shooter\n","Description: About This Game Survivor of the Journey is a survival game with roguelike elements that start with surviving and eventually defeat monsters.

It was made with the challenge of seeing just how interesting battles could be with standard, 5character, turnbased combat, and whether its character growth system would be fun while remaining simple. It's an RPG where progress involves figuring out enemy weakness and patterns, then picking the appropriate party members and skills for the situation, as opposed to just bruteforcing by grinding levels. It's packed with plenty of content to challenge yourself with, too. If you include collecting all the items and enemy skills, there's over a hundred hours of fun to be had.

The upgrades vary from increasing your pickaxe damage, your mine speed, the tokens and money you get, as well as various \"procc\" (programmed random occurrence) upgrades, for example; \"Slammer\", \"Nuker\", \"Key finder\", \"Token bag\" and more. The blocks stored in your backpack can be sold for in game money, which is used to unlock new mines with better blocks in them. The money can also be used to upgrade your offline \"Token generator\", buy pickaxe skins and eventually, unlock whole new planets. Planets can be travelled between with money (lots of it). You start on earth and from there you can unlock the moon (I know, technically not a planet). Which has much more valuable blocks, from the moon you can go to the next planet. The game currently has 5 different planets with different scenery, economy scale and dungeons. The dungeon is an alternative way of playing the game. After you unlock the dungeon (for money and tokens), instead of mining in a squared generated mined, you can then instead mine in a big cave area with ores scattered around the place. The ores in here are much more valuable and instead of being stored in your backpack, they will sometimes give you various item rewards when mines. Watch your steps though, because if you fall into any of the pits in the dungeon, everything you had gained in there will be lost. The dungeon the primary way of obtaining \"spirit flasks\", which can be used to receive a random \"Spirit\". Spirits are equippable \"buffs\" you can use in the game. Each spirit is unique and will enhance certain aspects of the game (while sometimes nerfing others). You can have 1 spirit equipped at a time and most spirits can be upgraded (by mining) for increased effects. The game has 25 different spirits ranging in 5 different rarity tiers. Spirits can be obtained by opening a spirit flask, which can be obtained in the dungeon, and from treasures. Treasures are a great way to give you a little bonus when playing. Treasures can be opened with a matching key, which can be obtained in various ways. When opening a treasure, a key will be consumed, and you will receive a random reward from that treasure. Generators can be used to earn passive income while playing, but also while offline. Each planet has a token generator and a money generator, which are upgraded with the opposite currency (money with tokens, and token with money). Upgrading your generator will increase it's capacity and the amount in generates per second. Generators can also be buffed by upgrading a certain mega upgrade with rebirth points . The \"Rebirth\" system is a way to replay the game with a buff. Once you have reached a certain \"level\" in the game and mined a certain amount of blocks, you can rebirth. Rebirthing will reset most of your stats (except for spirits and unlocked planets) but will give you a 10% money & token income boost as well as 1 rebirth point (RP) which you use to buy permanent mega upgrades . These upgrades are very different to the normal upgrades but are much more powerful. On top of all these features. HasteMiner 2 has much more to explore and try out.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 2113630\n","Tags: Action, Strategy, Tower Defense, 2.5D, 2D, 3D, Agriculture, Comedy, Conspiracy, Funny, Combat, Hack and Slash, Resource Management, Team-Based, 4 Player Local, Co-op, Local Co-Op, Multiplayer, Singleplayer, Free to Play\n","Description: About This Game \"Welcome to the field, farmer!

I'm in charge of the game's content and story design, my wife did the programming, and all the art elements you see are the work of my cousin who was still in college sacrificed a summer vacation. So the game looks very, very, very simple. However, I added a lot of rougelike design elements in the story. I like rougelike very much. I often think that if an adventure story can be combined with rougelike, our protagonist will feel like God is throwing dice. So the ending of the game and the easter eggs that can be triggered are quite a lot (the kind that racked my brains). All you need to play this game is a singleclick mouse, you'll know where to click, make a choice and just click.

It's time for the hunter to become the hunted. Teeth will be met with a club, and skin will be slashed with stone and pierced with arrows. Men's clash with dinosaurs for the land's supremacy is inevitable. Description Jurassic Clans sets in a world where dinosaurs coexist with primitive humans. The goal is to ensure your people thrive in this dangerous world. Survive and evolve your tribe to modern civilization by gathering resources essential to your village's expansion, research primitive technologies to improve your people's abilities, and unlock more and better tools to make sure you defend your village from animals to endure the upcoming end of times. ● Explore different locations to gather resources and find the right place to settle your village. ● Equip the natives with the besthunting weapons available and look for food, gather fruits from bushes and trees, and fish from the rivers. ● Build and evolve your village, from a cave to primitive tents, mud houses, and stone houses. Expand your village to increase your population. ● Assign different weapons according to your needs. An Axe is better suited to chop down a tree than a knife. A spear will benefit more while hunting than a pickaxe. ● Research different technologies to improve your village and your people's skills. ● Technologies allow the creation of new tools and weapons to be used in the right actions. ● Encounter different predators. Some are carnivorous and will attack without hesitation; others are more peaceful and most likely a target for hunting.

If that wasn't bad enough, they've now been dragged into a magical dimension known as The Frakk and forced to take part in a civil war between opposing monster girl tribes. Being a robotic battle maiden is honestly kind of cool, once you get past the abject humiliation of the whole situation. Being forced to obey the orders of your criminally insane roommate is a bit of a drawback though, as is being forced to refer to her as 'Mistress Ellie' due to some obstructive programming in your new robot body. Will Sam find a way to return to their original human body, or will they be spending the rest of eternity as a glorified appliance? Features A LifeSim/Visual Novel/RPG hybrid!

Your goal is to delve deep into a dungeon, find a portal to a mythical place called the Zorbus, where a mere mortal can ascend to demigodhood. You can recruit other creatures along the way so you don't have to adventure alone. Being a roguelike game, Zorbus creates the dungeon randomly so that every played game is slightly different. The game has permadeath, meaning that when a character dies, it really is permanent, and the player must begin a new game. You can save the game, but the save file is deleted when loaded. Zorbus does not have item identification or a hunger mechanic. A LIVING DUNGEON Thematically Zorbus draws influence from the late 70s and early 80s tabletop D&D campaigns, adventures and lore. The game tries to create a dungeon which feels alive, eventful, and rich in content. Something more than just empty rooms and corridors. Diversely shaped levels with themed content (throne rooms, prisons, hidden treasure caches, etc.) with good connectivity between the areas. The dungeon denizens act intelligently, fight each other, flee when threatened, and try to gather their friends to overcome a threat. Most creatures can use items, and can also pick them up from the dungeon floor. Creatures are not silent either, but comment on things with speech bubbles. The dungeon has dynamic lighting. There are light sources as dungeon furniture and in the hands of creatures, and these both can be lit and unlit. Some creatures have darkvision. Creatures react to light and sound. RPG RULE SYSTEM The rule system for the game is slightly influenced by the d20 system used in the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Zorbus has races and experience levels but no character classes. On each level up, you point buy skills and talents. CONTROLS & UI Keybindings are configurable. Mouse control is supported, but is not ideal for playing the game. A game controller can be used. The game has a targeting system, making it very easy to use ranged attacks or talents. Usable items and talents can be assigned to quickslots. Display size can be configured. You can play in windowed mode or fullscreen and with 32x32, 48x48 or 64x64pixel tile graphics or ASCII characters.

I'm Jiayu, an independent game producer. in this game. You can design and manufacture equipment and design your unique character. The origin of Luna: Luna's predecessor is actually the MOD integration of the ancient scroll 5. I called it Luna integration at that time. After spending a lot of time, I came to a conclusion: the engine of the ancient scroll 5 is out of date! So I decided to develop an open world RPG like the MOD integration of the ancient scroll 5. Of course, the support of MOD is the soul and indispensable soul, so the MOD system of this game will be one of its core playing methods. In order to let everyone develop MOD happily and experience the fun of creation, I created a set of MOD system with extremely low production threshold, aiming to make all players become MOD developers! About the development of the game: The development method of this game will be different from that of ordinary games. If you have played the current version of Red Moon, you will find that it is not complete and is a game framework. I plan to develop this game in a modular way. To put it simply, every time I finish a system, I will update it to the game for everyone to play. After absorbing everyone's opinions and suggestions, I will make some small updates, and then start to develop the next system, so as to follow the cycle. For example, the current version only has an item system, a basic motion system, and a MOD system. The current version of the Red Moon is at best a walking and changing simulator. In the next version, I will update the weapon system, life system, and basic combat system, so that the Red Moon becomes a mini action game that can fight to a certain extent. In the next version, I will update the building system, big map, and so on, Every time I make a piece of cake, I will flash it into your mouth immediately to avoid you waiting for years to play\n","\n","\n","App ID: 2131960\n","Tags: Runner, Arcade, Precision Platformer, Procedural Generation, 2D Platformer, Platformer, Action, 2D, Cute, Cartoony, Colorful, Hand-drawn, Minimalist, Stylized, Family Friendly, Controller, Indie, Space, Singleplayer\n","Description: About This Game Step into the shoes of RunBean, an astronaut who landed on a hazardous planet that tries its best to kill the intruder!

This fact is very important for aim training, as although you try your best to aim as fast as possible in other trainers, you generally won't force yourself to take shots which you don't feel confident in and are crucial for your development. In FRAIM you are forced to challenge yourself for your survival by design . Challenge by design Each track comes in five different difficulties to make sure that you can properly challenge yourself.

You will have to shoot down enemy aerial targets that were launched from enemy rocket systems over your city. Air defense is a set of measures and weapons that help shoot down enemy planes, helicopters and rockets. The game is not simple. You must aim and shoot not at the missile, but at a point further along its tracking route. Air targets are usually very high. While your projectile will fly to intercept the enemy target, a certain amount of time will pass. During this time, the enemy will fly some more distance. You must fire at this distance for your projectile to collide with the enemy missile. Remember that your weapon reloads. This is not an machine gun that can fire bursts. Therefore, each shot must be clearly on target. To fight the enemy, you will have a normal projectile, as well as four additional types of weapons. You will be able to buy new weapons with coins that can be collected during the game. With ingame coins, you can also purchase powerful powerups that will help you destroy the enemy. Achieve new records and get new ranks! There are 24 different ranks in the game (4 categories of 6). To set new records you need two things. First, play more often and practice your shooting skills.

Use the corresponding method to gain their favorability to make them your best teammates Combat and skills The game is based on the battle mode of the Japanese turnbased RPG, and has been improved in many aspects. The maximum number of combat roles is 8, which are divided into front vanguard, output and auxiliary. Only when they are in the corresponding positions can they exert better abilities. When the TP value reaches the peak, the rage form can be triggered, not only the attributes of all aspects are improved, but also the \"anger skills\" (nirvana skills) can be used. At the same time, the operation during the battle is simplified, the rhythm is accelerated, the operation is convenient, and the procrastination is avoided. The skills have been simplified, but the pertinence has been increased, the skill bar with too many skills has been abandoned, and some skills that are hardly used and have a low sense of presence have also been removed. Team skills can bring positive effects to the team, and special characters can also create props and special equipment for the team. Equipment and Inscription There are dozens of monster nests in the game, and each nest has a unique suit drop. These suits and equipment cannot be bought in the equipment store. For this purpose, the equipment map is specially designed for players to collect. Wearing the correct inscriptions can not only improve your own defense, but also increase your damage to monsters in battle, which is very important in critical battles. Task and assessment meeting Missions are divided into main missions, side missions and alliance missions. The main quest will advance the story of the game, the side quests can get relatively good rewards, and the alliance quests can be repeated. The number of completed alliance tasks will lead to changes in the rewards of the appraisal meeting. Of course, this is also related to the professional class of the alliance, which are complementary. If you become a lazy hero, although there will be no corresponding punishment, you can only get the basic reward of the evaluation meeting.

Such degenerate human beings are extremely dissatisfied with the Holy Spirit, because the reason why human beings have become like this is all the hands of the devil. Therefore, the Holy Spirit decided to punish the fallen human world, degrading all human beings into obsessive members who lost their feelings, and maybe even seduce the demon gods hiding in the dark by the way and destroy them together. The devil has been absorbing the depraved beliefs of human beings for a living, but if human beings are directly degraded into extreme attachments without emotion, it will also affect the intention of the devil.

We know your time is tighter than your bandwidth during a surprise update, so we’ll be honest: this is long. But if you give us five minutes and a little scroll wheel love, we promise it’ll be worth it. This is from the heart. Possibly a bit unhinged. Definitely written at 3am. And absolutely a window into why playing our games on your channel isn’t just helpful—it might be something that can’t be replicated elsewhere. We’ve worked so hard for so long, and we know you don’t owe us anything at all. All we ask for, is that you please try to remember a point in time when you just wanted five minutes of someone else’s attention, and you just wished someone would give you a chance. A time where you worked SO hard and you felt like giving up, and you just wished someone would give you an opportunity. It would mean the absolute world to us if you’d continue reading below: Over thirty games. Countless questions. Enough existential pondering to make a philosopher weep into their wine. And somehow—somehow—you lot stuck around. You played. You listened. You felt. Even when we didn’t ask you to. And now? Well, now it’s our turn to be the emotionally exposed weirdos at the party. Let’s cut through the dramatic violin music and get right to it: We’re not a corporation. We’re not a slick operation with espresso machines and ergonomic chairs. We are, quite literally, a few slightly unhinged people working in the middle of the night, high on selfloathing and instant noodles, pouring every drop of energy into games that might never make us rich but damn well better mean something. Most months, we spend more making games than we earn from them. Which is fine, because what’s money, really, besides paper you light on fire to keep the dream warm? On a good day, we make about $0.23 an hour. On a bad day? We call that Tuesday. We don’t do this for yachts or golden bidets. We do it because we believe—naively, recklessly, romantically—that in a world drowning in content, there’s still value in making something about YOU. Something that punches people in the guts and gives them a laugh on the way down. We pay artists, musicians, voice actors and specialists. And then we pay ourselves last, if at all. Because they deserve it, and frankly, we can survive off caffeine and vindication. We make games that feel. Not games that cater. Not games that pander. Games that prod at your soft parts and whisper, “You alright in there, champ?” Sometimes, people cry. Sometimes, they get mad. Sometimes, they stare into the middle distance like they’ve seen a ghost made of bad decisions. And to that we say: perfect. We’re not here to please everyone. We're here to reach someone. And if you’re a content creator, hello, you beautiful algorithmic beast. Yes—obviously it helps us if you stream our games. Duh. Every time someone with a following plays our game, one of our team gets their wings. Or at least an extra energy drink. But it can really help all parties. Players love seeing their favorite creators wrestle with personal questions. They love shouting at the screen, “THAT’S what you’d choose?!” They love comparing their results with yours and bonding over your weird choices. It creates desperately needed connection in a world lacking such. It makes your audience feel like they’re in the room with you, laughing, cringing, judging silently. So whether you’re looking to fill 30 minutes of airtime, spark some deep chat with your community, or just want to scream “NO” at morally ambiguous questions while chat screams back “YES,” this is your moment. And if you don’t believe us, just take a stroll through YouTube. Search for The Test. See what the community’s saying. Spoiler: they’re the most supportive and lovely people you could imagine. Unreasonably lovely. The kind of lovely that makes you feel like maybe, just maybe, the internet isn’t a complete wasteland after all. We’ve given away games for free and made a handful of free games so those who couldn't afford to play, still got the opportunity. We’ve sold them cheap, real cheap. We do that not because we think they’re worth less—but because we know what it’s like to have nothing and still want to feel something. So here’s what we’re asking for: One try. If you love it? Great. If you hate it? Fair. But someone else might love it. You might really love it. And you’ll never know unless you try. We’re not asking for your money. We’re asking for your curiosity. Your time. Your heart, if you’re willing. And if you give us that—if you feel something—then all the sleepless nights and broken chairs and unpaid hours will have been worth it. Thank you for playing. Thank you for listening. Thank you for making the pain feel a little less stupid. We’re Randumb Studios. And we’re not stopping. Not until the lights go out, the server crashes, and someone pries the keyboard from our cold, carpaltunnelled hands. With love, sarcasm, and a mild vitamin deficiency, – The Mad Bastards at Randumb Studios  Zombie Apocalypse Survival Simulator The Apocalypse has come and gone, and all that's left are the voracious dead and The Wolves... Well, and then... There's you, of course. You will be asked a series of questions about Zombie Apocalypse Scenarios and must provide honest answers about what you would do if you were in potentially lifethreatening situations.

What is Zombie Apocalypse Survival Simulator? Well, in essence, it's just what it sounds like! It's our way of reading the feedback players have left for us on previous titles such as The Test Trilogy and others, taking their words into heavy consideration, and creating new experiences that players want to play! Everyone at some point or another imagines themselves fighting the walking dead, engaging in handtohand combat, and encountering awful survival situations that we always wonder if we're strong enough to endure... Everyone thinks about surviving in an age where mankind no longer belongs... But how many people would actually cut it? How many people would actually survive, how many would die, and how many would thrive? Well, this simulator asks you a series of questions, and through your answers, will let you know your chances of surviving in the realm of the dead! Would you survive the combat? Would you survive the politics? Would you continue on into the new world? Would you Survive, or would you be just another victim of looters, bandits, or worst of wall... The Voracious Dead... There's only one way to find out... Features: Short and sweet Be a part of history with Player  Developer interaction The only game with this theme of its kind Very atmospheric and psychological Sit back, relax, and answer indepth questions to reveal survival scenarios Super affordable for a unique experience A little bit funny.

As the developer, I believe that transparency towards the player is the key feature for a good game and a healthy community. Since I am a solo developer, the content of the game is somewhat limited, the performance not optimal (hence the crazy system requirements) and the balancing still not perfect. Still, I did not want to mark this title as Early Access, since I found this misleading since I'm not really planning for too many Updates. Apart from that, I would appreciate every piece of feedback. Share your ideas for improvement, better balancing or anything that comes to mind. As a single person, my capacitites in the fields of balancing and performance testing on multiple devices are somewhat limited. Therefore I am happy about every piece of information I can get. Since Jotunn is very short and not perfect, everyone should have the opportunity to play this game for free (should be obvious) I am looking forward to making more, longer and better games in the future and I am exciting for the upcoming journey!\n","\n","\n","App ID: 2171930\n","Tags: Horror, Survival Horror, Supernatural, Psychological Horror, Psychological, Investigation, Hidden Object, 3D, VR, Time Management, Dark, Mystery, Strategy, Realistic, Puzzle, First-Person, Demons, Action, Zombies, Linear\n","Description: About This Game DEATHWATCH  PRELUDE is a horror game in which you are tasked to observe haunted locations, log supernatural events and eradicate any potential paranormal threats.

This follows the Aasimar: Ashara, Half Elves: Embra and Ish Ma'el, and Marleek (custom race): Victalyassa as they join up in the Unnamed Guild, led by a Dwarf: Drosko, to complete a task for the High King which will put all of their skills and abilities to the test. The heroes meet up outside the city of Valtaska, on the peninsula of Tanaviak , to receive the quest that will start them on a long journey to save the cycle and end the evil machinations of the \"Sand Cult\" and their mysterious plans to bring about the end of the world as they know it. The quest to save the world will bring the heroes all over the peninsula and far beyond as the party interacts with Kings, High Society Nobles, Cultists, Brothel Women, Giant Flying Fire Whales, the Embodied Gods, and SO. MUCH. MORE. The Tabletop RPG is played using Dungeons and Dragons 5e, with the rulesets, D20 system, and all. The Video Game adventure is no different, incorporating all it can from the tabletop to make it as authentic to the way it was originally played as possible. You will meet various races and classes of DnD 5e and custom races and classes created by Magenth. Though the campaign in the tabletop RPG kicked off with the quest, in the video game there will be a prelude which will introduce the players to the various mechanics and types of quests which will be found throughout the game including: D20 combat and skill checks, DnD spells and abilities, and a lot of different plugins credited in the game to present the best experience to players and the most accurate to the tabletop while still remaining a video game with all the considerations... considered.

Tentokrát však bez slušivé policejní uniformy a blýskavého služebního odznaku. Stal se soukromým detektivem. Nic jiného mu totiž po vyhazovu od policie nezbylo. Nemůže tedy už ochromovat své protivníky oním klasickým \"jménem zákona\", ale na druhou stranu mu už právě tento zákon nesvazuje při náročném pátrání ruce a nebrzdí ho v rozletu. První zákazník, tedy zákaznice, na sebe nedá dlouho čekat. Případ se zpočátku zdá více než triviální. Posuďte sami  co zajímavého může být na pátrání po kuchaři, kterého hledá jeho bývalá manželka. To je však jen začátek. Vše se komplikuje ve chvíli, kdy Pankrác zjistí, že kuchař zřejmě nebude tak docela obyčejná vařečka z čtvrtý cenový, jak se původně mohlo zdát, ale osobně se staral o jídelníček slavné hokejové hvězdy. To už dělá z původně nudného vyšetřování přímo kauzu. A co teprve, když Pankrác zjistí, že slavná hokejová hvězda zmizela spolu s kuchařem...

While it meets your expectations from an operating system to a certain extent with the applications it contains, CHAQS progresses in the direction of more challenges in terms of gameplay. Therefore, it meets the visual needs of the user with its graphical interface, but the terminal creates the entire game aspect of CHAQS. Although all of the terminal commands are written to meet gaming needs, some of them can operate outside of these needs. The prepared challenges do not fully reflect realworld ethical hacking, they are similar. Terminal Terminal is a commandline interpreter that provides a command line user interface for CHAQS. The terminal, which was developed inspired by the Unix shell, is the most important part of the game with dozens of commands and command line utilities.

Beginner challenges offer insights that are designed to provide you with the necessary guidance, gracefully and intelligibly. Challenges allow you to interact with all terminal commands and command line utilities. Runtime Compiler CHAQS has a runtime compiler that executes a code file of the C# programming language with the execute command. Embedded Browser The Browser+ application offers you a CEFbased ingame browser. Functional Programs CHAQS has been prepared by deducting your expectations from an operating system. It has programs and widgets such as video player, music player, notepad, photo gallery. Bliss Speech Recognizer Bliss transforms the voice command into action according to predefined methods. Steganography CHAQS has a comprehensive set of steganography tools with the stegoimage program, which shows the different channel results of images with a graphical interface, and commandline programs such as amorse, audiodecoder, dtmf, steg, strings. Snap Layouts Snap layouts are a series of predefined zones where you can place each app for quick access. Snap layouts help users arrange applications in five different ways. Keyboard Hook The keyboard hook allows for easy switching between programs in CHAQS and disables the operating system's native Alt+Tab combination while CHAQS is running. In case the keyboard hook is active, you cannot use the alt and tab keys of the operating system in any way. Automatic API Calls Automatic API calls performs an automatic request at the beginning of the game for valid api call files located in the api folder under the Documents directory and shows the request result in the accessibility panel.

Inhabit my mind as I lose my grasp on reason. Attempt to piece together cogent responses to questions from doctors, friends, and family as psychosis takes over, and ultimately try to get back to stability. Key Features Inhabit the developer's mind and build your own responses to dialogue. Experience an Autobiographical story detailing the experience of a psychotic break. An hour of gameplay. Developer Statement I started making this game several years after being hospitalized for a manic episode. I was fixated on the experience for the whole time. Trying to piece together what was real and what was dreamt, trying to even remember the sequence of events in chronological order, and every so often when I thought I had shaken the grip of obsessing about the hospitalization, I would have flashbacks that opened up my freshly healed wounds. As a game developer, I was fascinated by some of the systems of thought that were going on in my head, and that gave me the idea for this game.  I designed game mechanics and systems to tell the story of my psychosis in a different way than I have seen it expressed before. Making the game really helped me with my flashbacks and organized the way I thought about my illness, and the experience of my hospitalization. I hope that it gives other people some insight into my brain and also into the nature of psychosis and manic depression.\n","\n","\n","App ID: 2185470\n","Tags: Strategy, Casual, Singleplayer, Puzzle, 2D Platformer, Match 3, Puzzle Platformer, Spelling, Exploration, 2D, Historical, Indie, Education, Relaxing, Funny, Text-Based, Board Game\n","Description: About This Game Chinese characters have been in use for the longest time, and they are the only one of the major writing systems that have been passed down from ancient times.The \"Chinese characters\" will promote Chinese culture and experience the beauty of Chinese culture in a different way.

Less than 1% of human survivors have wandered around and built shelters one by one. Although people are not sure whether there will be tomorrow after tomorrow, the Survivors' Alliance is a confederation organization formed by them. Its leader is Pavlov, the whistler, who aims to eliminate zombies and rebuild their homes. The protagonist dragged his life to escape from Shengtian and came to No. 7182 Shelter. The conditions here are not bad. There is moss on the ground, and even uninfected rabbits can be seen in the wild. There is also an AI robot called ALYX, which was left by the Alliance Science and Technology Association. It depends on your ability whether you can survive the wave of body attacks, and then enter the league, seize cities and territories together, and rebuild the world order. In other parts of the world, other people's camps are scattered sporadically, and can be transmitted there through crystals. Whether it is an enemy or a friend, aggression or alliance depends on your diplomatic skills. Of course, in this end of the world, perhaps only strength and interests are the final determinants. Remember that the mobile phone in the game can communicate with other players (VR Chat). Call them as soon as possible. The league has a Hellsplit Arena, where you can compete with them fairly by virtue of your individual combat ability. At that time, you will be noticed by the world (FOCUS on YOU). If your fighting skills are not good, you can consider looking for Sairento, who will teach you superb fighting skills. To survive, you can only wave your Beat Saber to hunt some animals and get necessities. To block the growing tide of corpses, you can't do it alone. The key to success is to develop camp technology, rapidly manufacture and upgrade automatic artillery, support vertical takeoff and landing UAV, super hot laser fence and other highlevel equipment. Don't forget that before the fusion battery is developed, there must be enough solar panels to power it, otherwise, These devices are just a pile of scrap metal. Also, KANOJO, whom you saved, should cultivate her well, and she will become a powerful assistant in your camp construction in the future. As long as you can resist zombies, you can even use the spells of Eastern Taoism or Buddhism. Blade and sorcery are indispensable. Go, fight, fight, fight until you fall. Remaining zombies of human consciousness are very difficult to deal with. They sometimes attack humans and sometimes help them. Therefore, the Alliance often quarrels about how to treat them. The mainstream view is that there is a mysterious wizard organization that uses the secrets in the ancient Elder Scrolls to manipulate them. The key is that there are many of them, Among us.

Together you hunt underground, demonworshipping cults in a grimdark city. To defeat the cultists you will have to use your combat skills and supernatural abilities to stop them before they summon terrible creatures into our world. A challenging thirdperson combat game. Strong enemies and low health and resources can make it feel like the odds are against you.

Engaging Flow The combat is structured around rewarding those risk takers with good timing. Don't be shy! Find your opening and introduce them to your demon infested sword. There are very few defensive moves you can make, aside from dodging, so your best bet is trying to enter what we like to call, the flow.

This consumes ones of your two tokens. If your left with no tokens, you can no longer perform this move. Luckily, defeating a cultist will instantly recharge a token. In other words, be sure to finish the fights you start. Need a boost? Dodging will be your best bet at avoiding an attack. However, did you know that by timing your dodge right before the attack lands you can activate a perfect dodge? Doing so will light up your sword. Aside from making you look like a badass, during a limited amount of time any attacks you land on an enemy will gradually give you health. The best defense, has always been good offense. Enter the Abyss Inner Abyss explores a unique blend of dark gothic fantasy and the early industrial revolution. Clouds of soot dulls the city in a constant dark fog, and the streets are dotted with both oil and electric lamps desperately trying to light up the moldy brick streets.
